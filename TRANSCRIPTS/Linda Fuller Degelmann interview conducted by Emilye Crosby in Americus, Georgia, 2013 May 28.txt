EC: Great. I was wondering if you could start by telling us a little bit about your family and background growing up in Alabama.
    Is that correct? 

LD: I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1941, and that happened to be the phenomenal year when the atom bomb was used in
    Japan. So, of course, I was unaware of that at that time. But my father is a businessman, graduated from the University of
    Alabama, thought that it would be good for him to become active in the Army. I think actually that was the—those were the
    days when reserve units were called into active duty. And he didn’t go overseas, but he was assigned to the procurement
    office with the Army in Philadelphia. So, when I was still a toddler, we moved to Philadelphia for a couple of years.When
    the war was over, we moved back to Alabama and settled in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. And that’s where I was raised until I
    married in 1959.

EC: Did your father continue to work in business?

LD: He did. After the war, he and my mother started a business in downtown Tuscaloosa called Caldwell Electric Company. It’s
    right on Broad Street, and so I became very familiar with all kinds of appliances. I think we were the first ones in town,
    in the city, to have a dishwasher.

EC: Wow!

LD: [Laughs]

EC: That’s memorable.

LD: And maybe one of the first televisions, you know, with the big antennas on top of our house. So, they were very engaged in
    business while I was growing up in school. I have one older sister.And one thing that I—was real sharp in my memory about
    my dad’s business, related to the Southern culture at that time, was he had a repair shop down in the basement of the
    store. And one of the guys was a black man, and I think he was mostly involved in delivering appliances that were sold. My
    dad would have—my dad and mom would have an annual picnic, cookout at their house every year, and he never would be
    invited. And, you know, I remember wondering about that, you know, “Why was not he included?”And, of course, I went to
    segregated school. And there was just no question about whether they should be integrated. You know, it was just the way
    things were. Being a university town, I think, the University of Alabama, I think we were exposed to more integrated
    situations, although it was after I married, that the university was actually integrated.

EC: Really? Yeah. Do you—you said you remember wondering why this one employee wasn’t ever invited or wasn’t at the
    picnic. Did you ever ask your parents? Or do you know why you thought about that? 

LD: I think I did bring it up, but it was just sort of dismissed.

EC: Um-hmm.

LD: I don’t remember a specific answer.

EC: Yeah. Do you remember—I mean, other than that, which is really interesting, do you remember sort of when you first began
    to think about race and sort of understand the separation and the hierarchies that existed?

LD: Well, actually I think it was after I married. I married—like I said, I married in 1959. And my husband, Millard, had been
    very active in youth work in his church. And often there would be like a conference, a youth conference, up in the North
    somewhere. And when he would go up there, he became aware of some differences. Specifically, he remembered being greeted by
    a black woman, you know, and he thought, “Wow! [Laughs] That was pretty interesting,” you know. So, he was at the
    conference with black people, and he had a different perspective, outside of his upbringing, which was on the
    Georgia-Alabama border around West Point, Georgia.So, he became aware of some transitions that were taking place. And so, I
    picked up an awareness from him. And we talked about, you know, how things were segregated, and we tried to reach out to
    black people whenever we had an opportunity to. And I began to realize, “Hey, they’re just people like me,” but it was
    mostly in a church setting.

EC: I’ve got a couple of questions about that. So, do you remember things like the Brown decision, or the Montgomery bus
    boycott? I guess you would have been in, like, high school or maybe even a little younger for those.

LD: You know, right after Millard and I married, we moved to Montgomery.

EC: Yeah.

LD: And he and a fellow law student had gone in business while they were in law school, and they set up a law practice in
    Montgomery. I attended Huntington College, which was, I think, all-white at that time. But then, things were occurring, like
    the bus boycott. Because while I was in school, I also had children and I needed someone to come to the house to keep the
    children. And so, I always had to go into town to pick up the lady.

EC: Oh, really?

LD: Of course it was the buses. She wouldn’t ride the bus. And it was an inconvenience, but yet, here again, I just accepted
    it as the way things were. 

EC: As part of how that worked.

LD: Yeah. And then, there was the Selma to Montgomery march. Actually, let me back up. The next conflict in Montgomery were the
    Freedom Rides. And Millard and Morris Dees actually went down to the bus station out of curiosity, just to see what would
    happen when some of those buses came in. And they were shocked at how people were beat up as soon as they stepped off the
    bus.

EC: So, they were there that first day, that day they had that big—?

LD: Well, yeah, there may have been several—

EC: I’m sure there were.

LD: Different Freedom Rides that came into Montgomery.

EC: Yeah.

LD: But this particular one, I can remember how they were just shocked at how brutally people were beat up. And they began to
    think, “Hey, this is—something is wrong with this picture here! This is terrible!” You know, both of them grew up in
    the church and, you know, they knew about brotherly love. And times were already beginning to change, with thoughts of
    equality and justice and that kind of thing.But what they witnessed just made them—their minds shift a hundred and eighty
    degrees. And whereas they had been sort of part of the Klan—they had been in politics in law school and had spoken on
    behalf of the man running for lieutenant governor, and they went to Klan rallies to speak on behalf of McDonald Gallion.
    They never were members of the Klan, but they were actually sort of members on the side, because they received the issues of
    what was called The Fiery Cross. That was a publication. I don’t know how widespread it was. It may have been just the
    Alabama Klan that published it. But in fact, they had represented a man that—I’ve forgotten exactly what the case was,
    but they had represented a member of the Klan for some kind of legal action. And they called him into their office.
    Apparently he was one of the leaders. And they told him that they wanted to cancel their subscription to The Fiery Cross.
    [Laughs] And Morris took a pistol out and put it on his desk when he said it, “We want to cancel our subscription to The
    Fiery Cross.”And it was just a few nights later when their offices, Fuller and Dees Marketing, was broken into and a lot
    of typewriters smashed, you know, paint slung on the wall, and some vile language, you know, sprayed on the wall. And so,
    they began to get repercussions and learn that, you know, this was not a very popular thing to do, but they knew it was
    right. 

EC: How did you feel about it? You know, as they’re going through this change, it must have an impact on you?

LD: Oh, yeah. Well, I didn’t see the beatings that occurred from the Freedom Ride. But, of course, I heard them talk about it.
    And I thought myself, “This isn’t right.”And then, there was the Selma to Montgomery march. Some pastors that Millard
    knew up in Ohio, Indiana—I forgot now where they were from—came down to participate, and they didn’t have a place to
    stay. And they got in touch with Millard and said, “Hey, you know, can we put our bedroll down on your living room floor
    and have a place to sleep at night?” And, of course, Millard said, “Sure!” And our neighbors found out about it,
    [laughs] and we got some pretty nasty phone call.But not only did the marchers—there were four or five or six of
    them—would stay at our house, but Millard and Morris would take them back to the march route each morning. And they can
    remember their license plate, you know, the photograph of their license plate, and thus we got some additional nasty calls,
    you know, from the broader community.So, they made a stand, and it wasn’t real significant. We never participated in any
    marches ourselves, but we definitely began to observe, began to see, you know, that times were changing and needed to
    change. And we just felt so badly for people who were discriminated against and we decided, you know, somehow or another, we
    needed to get side. [Laughs]

EC: How did that affect your sort of social life, your church life in Montgomery while you’re still living there and while
    you’re sort of rethinking?

LD: Well, our neighbors wouldn’t speak to us ever again. We actually left. Millard and I left Montgomery in 1965. This is a
    whole other story about our marriage crisis. Millard and Morris both wanted to become millionaires by age thirty. And that
    was requiring them to work night and day, night and day, and it basically just destroyed our marriage. I left Millard. And
    out of that marriage crisis, we felt called to give away all of our wealth and basically start totally over again. And we
    said, “We want God to be in control this time. We’ve been doing what we want to do. We want God to be in control.”So,
    this was mid-sixties, and Millard had a lot of energy. [Birds sing] He didn’t want to just sit around, you know. So, the
    pastor that I counseled with at Broadway United Church of Christ in New York City, Dr. Durgin, was on the board of Tougaloo
    College, a predominantly or totally black college then in Mississippi. And Millard asked him, you know, “Do you have any
    ideas on what we could do, now that I’ve left business, sold my interest, half-interest to my partner, Morris Dees,”
    who, by the way, started Southern Poverty Law Center. 

EC: Um-hmm, yeah.

LD: That was five or six years later. He continued Fuller and Dees Marketing for a number of years before he started Southern
    Poverty Law Center. And so, Dr. Durgin said, “Well, I’m on the board for Tougaloo, and we so badly need a new dorm.”
    He said, “How would you like to raise the money for this new dorm on campus?” Millard said, “Okay!” You know, “I
    know how to make money. I know how to raise money.” So, he said, “Okay.” [Laughs]

EC: Was that a volunteer job then?

LD: Well, actually, it was, because we kept a little bit of money to live on. I think he got a little bit of a salary, you know.
    We had three kids by that time, and we actually planted ourselves in the New York City area.

EC: Okay, I wondered.

LD: And Dr. Durgin provided an office for Millard to work out of, because, I mean, we couldn’t come back to Montgomery to
    raise money. The money was in the North. [Laughs] And so, he needed that environment to raise that significant money. And we
    actually settled our family in New Jersey for two years.

EC: That must have been a change for you.

LD: Well, it was, but I’m the type of person that I don’t mind a challenge, and it was a whole new exciting chapter in our
    lives. [Birds sing] We had become so miserable with so much wealth and stuff and the failing of our marriage that we wanted
    to get back to basics. He and I both had a simple, middle-class upbringing. And it felt good to get kind of back to the
    basics and be focused on something bigger than ourselves, something with meaning, something that would put our Christian
    faith into action.

EC: When you were living in New Jersey, what was the racial dynamics like there at that time, in the community that you were
    part of?[Birds continue to sing periodically]

LD: Well, as best as I can remember, in Montclair and the Glen Ridge area, it was predominantly white. I think it was because of
    the economy. It was sort of a wealthy bedroom suburb. We lived in—we rented the bottom floor of a house, so we didn’t
    live in one of the really nice houses in that area. But Millard commuted into the city by bus every day. Our oldest child,
    son Chris, went to first grade there, and it seemed like there were two or three black children in the class. There didn’t
    seem to be any racial discrimination, as far as housing was concerned. It was more an affordability issue, I think, for most
    black families in the area. Of course, Newark was close by, but that was another county. So, the population of the schools
    would probably have been integrated but predominantly black there. But by that time, you know, we had become very
    comfortable around black people, even sought out friendships with black families. So, it was a different environment from
    being in the South, for sure. 

EC: Yeah. I was wondering if, with the Freedom Rides, when you were talking about your husband and Morris Dees going and looking
    at that, you know, and seeing that violence, and the impact it had, and their previous affiliation with the Klan. I guess a
    couple of questions. Do you remember what—you know, were they sympathetic to the Klan? Or was this a practical kind of
    political affiliation? I mean, I know you said they weren’t exactly members but, you know, going and speaking. Do you
    remember how they felt about it before they began to question?

LD: Well, it was just like there’s the Lions Club or the Kiwanis Club, you know. Their activities were different. But they
    weren’t really a part of the meetings, other than back in law school in the late fifties, you know, going to speak.

EC: It was sort of a political alliance kind of thing?

LD: Well.

EC: It was just part of the structure?

LD: Yeah, they kind of accepted it, you know. I guess they thought they were a little radical, you know. [Laughs]

EC: But so it is, right? One of the pieces of background information I got mentioned that their law firm defended some of the
    white men involved in the attacks on the Freedom Riders. Does that—do you remember anything about that?

LD: You know, that—no, I don’t.

EC: I was wondering if that was the person that they were having that interaction with around The Fiery Cross or—?

LD: It could have been, but I’m not sure.

EC: Yeah. 

LD: I may have it in some notes somewhere. I wish Millard were here, because he could have told you every little detail of
    that.

EC: He had that kind of memory?

LD: Yes, definitely.

EC: Yeah. What was Huntington like during that period? I think Bob Zellner, one of the student activists, graduated from
    Huntington in the late fifties. And he talks about—or maybe it was even earlier—but he talks about taking a sociology
    class, and they ended up doing some firsthand research that involved going to meet Dr. King, and some of them got kicked out
    of school. But in some ways, it was also a good environment for him, at least. So, I wonder what it was like for you to be
    attending Huntington at that time and what the atmosphere was like.

LD: I don’t remember any kind of activity like that. I was married and living at home. I wasn’t real active on campus, as if
    I would have been had I lived in a dorm. I was there, beginning 1961 through ’66, and it could have happened either before
    or after.

EC: He would have been there before you were there. But I just was curious, you know, whether any of your professors talked
    about race at all, or if that was just sort of outside of that experience?

LD: No, it was—the Christian emphasis was still pretty strong at the college. Some colleges and universities had started off
    with firmer Christian association; it was still—I remember Old and New Testament were required for every freshman
    entering, ethics and philosophy were required. And that really broadened my mind a whole lot, the ethics and philosophy,
    because it examined values in every aspect of life, so that you could kind of objectively look at yourself, your environment
    and decide, you know, what is valuable.Well, I’m trying to think. I don’t remember any black students there. I don’t
    know that they would have been excluded had they applied. It was pretty expensive. I only got to go there because Millard
    was financing my education, and he was able to do that. But here, again, as far as the housing is concerned, it might have
    been—it was probably just not affordable, or black students may not have felt comfortable. But I know after I left, in the
    seventies or eighties, there was a real effort to recruit to bring a more diverse student population to Huntington. And, of
    course, I think that exists today.

EC: Um-hmm, yeah, I’m sure.John Bishop: Can we pause just a minute?

LD: Okay. [Recording stops and then continues]

JB: Okay, we’re back again.

EC: I imagine you must have been pretty busy with the small children and going to school.

LD: [Gasps] Yes. My parents had really implanted in my mind and my sister’s mind that we should strive to get at least our
    undergraduate degree. And, in fact, I married when I was eighteen. And I promised my parents that, if I married at that
    young age, that I would continue. I would go to school. Well, [laughs] we had our first baby eleven months after we
    married.

EC: [Laughs]

LD: So, when he was ten months old, that’s when we moved to Montgomery, and I enrolled in Huntington. At first, I just went
    part time, and I started figuring up, “Gee, it’s going to take me ten or twelve years to finish!” I said, “If I’m
    away from home and I have help with the children and the housework,” I said, “I might as well go full time.” So, I did
    and I finished in five years.

EC: Yeah.

LD: Yeah! Whoo! I remember the time when the marchers were staying in our house, I felt kind of bad, because we didn’t know
    when they would be getting in at night, I left them on their own to prepare their food, and I thought, “Oh, my
    goodness!” You know, “Why wasn’t I more hospitable?” But, you know, I had exams, I had kids. [Laughs] I don’t
    know, I was young, very young, in my early twenties, and I just thought we were providing a floor for them to sleep on, you
    know. I didn’t know we were feeding the army, you know. But anyway, it was an interesting experience.

EC: Did you have a sense of the historical significance of the event at the time? The Selma to Montgomery March and then the
    Voting Rights Act?

LD: You know, not having been actually physically, emotionally involved, I don’t know that I understood the significance of it
    until after we left Montgomery, until later when I became aware of more and more activities.

EC: Yeah.

LD: But, you know, Dr. King was jailed right here in Americus, Georgia. And they—he was like a hot potato, you know. They
    quickly got him down to forty miles south of here and put him in Albany jail. 

EC: Oh, was that during the Albany protests? So, that’s where he was brought during the Albany Movement protest, I think,
    probably. In December of ’61, there were a lot of arrests in Albany, and they moved people out to all the different
    counties.

LD: Could have been.

JB: from here down to Albany. Is that what you said?

LD: I thought I understood that was the case.

JB: That’s what you said, yeah.

LD: Uh-huh. You know, I wasn’t here. This is just what I’ve heard. I’ve got people that we could check with to make sure.

EC: Yeah. Well, there were also protests—SCLC was back involved in Americus, I think, in ’65, maybe, I’m not sure. So—

LD: We didn’t learn—we didn’t visit Koinonia Farm, that had suffered a lot because of their activity as far as being very
    sympathetic to blacks in the area of—they hated that there was so much poverty and injustice, and the way that blacks were
    treated, and so they befriended blacks. They always ate together the main meal, and they were all kind of treated on the
    same social level, and that’s what got the local people so agitated. [Laughs] But that was pretty much over by the time we
    moved here.After Millard raised the money to build that dormitory at Tougaloo College, we felt called to come back South and
    move to Koinonia to work with Clarence Jordan and the other people that were there. And the violence had subsided. It’s a
    fascinating history that [sighs] I wish we had time to go into. But, as I mentioned, there’s an excellent documentary,
    hour-long documentary that our daughter made.

EC: Yeah.

LD: And was aired on public television all over the country, Briars in the Cotton Patch, so that pretty much tells that story.
    But as, you know, we had four kids. We were starting to build houses. We had partnership farming. We had partnership
    industries. I was pretty much stretched just to live at Koinonia and be a part of the things that would actually help the
    black people and society there.

JB: But that’s part of what happened Maybe you give a brief summary of what , a short [Laughs] 

LD: [Laughs] Okay, basically, when we moved there, we got to know a lot of families that were living in shacks. Koinonia had
    befriended these people over the years and helped them out in various ways, but the housing was just so strikingly poor. And
    a lot of these houses were on the farms of the—and, you know, part of the whole system of the—[laughs] well, my mind’s
    blanking.

EC: Sharecropping.

LD: [Laughs] The sharecropper system. Thank you. Yeah, and so, we would visit some of these shacks, and there were big holes in
    the roofs, holes in the floors, newspapers had been tacked up on the walls to insulate as best they could, windows had been
    broken out, and, of course, there was no attempt by the farmer to fix the houses. But we had some property at Koinonia, and
    we said, “Well, why don’t we start what we call a partnership housing movement?” We’re in partnership with the
    people that need the help. We’re in partnership with God, who has given us the direction to help our brothers and sisters
    in need.And since blacks could not go to the bank to get loans to buy a house or even buy land, we thought, “Well, we’ll
    just dedicate some of the land here,” the two thousand and something acres at Koinonia, and start building houses, sell
    them to the families, no profit, no interest. That was the only way the families could afford it. And they were simple
    houses, like the ones that we started off building were cinderblock. But, for the first time, families had an indoor
    bathroom, running water, things we just take for granted—closets, kitchen cabinets! You know? Wow! We saw it make such a
    difference in the families.The Johnson family was the first family to move into one of the houses. And then, there were
    families after families that moved in. I remember we kind of hit a point where there were about ten houses—ten families
    moved in. And there were little kids running all over the neighborhood! You know, we got to—we had a little playground for
    them, and a lot of them didn’t even know what their names were. Their grandmamas were taking care of them. And so, since
    my degree was in elementary education, we set up a child development center there.So, one thing kind of just led to another.
    And then, we noticed that blacks didn’t have—they were either unemployed or underemployed. So, we started partnership
    industries. Not only did we have the pecan plant and growing peanuts and corn, but we started a sewing industry and a
    pottery, so that we could give employment to people that low income. [Clears throat] That’s pretty much it in a nutshell.
    We lived at Koinonia for five years to develop these types of things. But the thing that really interested us the most was
    the housing component. That’s what really seemed to make a difference in the lives of poor black people. 

EC: Did your idea about that develop through the experience with all these programs? I mean, also you’re doing the housing and
    the child development and the economic development, and so, out of all of that, out of that experience, then you focused in
    on the housing?

LD: On the housing. And we became interested in seeing if that same philosophy, those same principles would work outside the
    U.S. We moved to Africa. We took our whole family to Africa for three years and pioneered the work there. Same thing, no
    profit, no interest, long term to pay, twenty years to pay. And it worked there!We came home after building about a hundred
    and twenty houses, and it took us about a year and a half [laughs] to get the concrete block factory running, and, you know,
    the first house built, but it was a tremendous success. And when we came home—see, we’d been raising support from
    churches, individuals. Koinonia put some money into it. Companies like Lilly, you know, had given us a grant to buy
    concrete.And so, when we came back home, we thought, “Gee, you know, this ought to be a—probably work most anywhere in
    the world where there’s poverty.” And we came back with the thought that we would start a worldwide ministry right at
    Koinonia. But things had changed a little bit, the leadership, and they said, “No, we just want to build houses right here
    in Sumter County. We don’t want to do this whole big worldwide thing.” So, we—they gave us part of a chicken barn.
    [Laughs] We had a little desk and a telephone. And we eventually named what we were doing Habitat for Humanity.We moved into
    town. We needed to make a living. Millard set up a law office and Habitat, he and I, Mom and Pop, you know. Back then,
    telephone systems were very unsophisticated. We had one phone on each of our desks for Habitat, and another phone for the
    law office. [Laughs] And I had to remember, you know—

EC: [Laughs] Which is—who are you answering?

LD: [Laughs] Fuller Law Office or Habitat for Humanity! But that gave us the foundation to involve volunteers and grow Habitat
    for Humanity over the next thirty years to the point where we were in a hundred countries and have built houses for more
    than a million people.

EC: Wow. That’s remarkable! Really remarkable. I want to go back. What was the Koinonia community like when you moved into the
    community? I know that you said that it changed a couple of times. And then we were also talking before we went on film, and
    you were telling me about what it was like when you would come into town when you were living out there. I would love to
    hear more about that. 

LD: When we moved to Koinonia in the summer of 1968, there were very few people at Koinonia. In fact, Clarence Jordan and his
    wife, well, they had one son still at home, they were exploring other places to go, because Koinonia had gotten to a real
    low ebb. There was only one other family there. There were a few blacks living there, but Clarence was feeling that the work
    was over there, and he would just go teach in a seminary or something like that.But then, when we wrote to him—well,
    actually, Millard wrote him, jotted him a little note when he was flying to a speaking engagement, and he said, “Clarence,
    I’m thinking about leaving Tougaloo, my work is almost done. What have you got up your sleeve?” [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs]

LD: So, Clarence wrote back and said, “Well, I don’t have anything up my sleeve. But maybe God has something up His sleeve
    for both of us.” So, they got together at a church in Atlanta where Clarence was speaking at a revival, or a series of
    sermons. And, Clarence would preach at night. And then, and Millard and Clarence would talk during the day, and they all
    kinds of possibilities. The idea was sort of—for us to move down to Koinonia and then maybe move to Atlanta to start some
    ministry.But the more we thought about it—and we brought in a group of friends, a variety of people, pastors, business
    people, and we brainstormed one big weekend. And they came up with this—they named it Koinonia Partnerships—and we would
    experiment with partnership housing, partnership industries, partnership farming, putting the disenfranchised people with
    the more skilled and more able people to build up society and give people a chance that they never had before.So, yeah, we
    [laughs]—if you go out there to Koinonia, you would see that it’s a very simple lifestyle, and most of the places for
    families are just very small clapboard houses that were built by volunteers over the years. And so, we actually moved into
    the apartment upstairs that Clarence and Florence lived at. It was one of the first structures that they had built back in
    the forties.And [laughs] I’ll never forget when my mother and daddy came for their first visit. You know, they were
    accustomed to visiting us in this big thirteen room house in Montgomery, Alabama, with luxury cars and all this kind of
    stuff. And they climbed up these rickety old stairs and walked into my kitchen. [Laughs] I thought my mother was going to
    faint. She said, “Oh, no! No progress in three generations!” [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs] 

LD: Oh, my goodness! You know, I don’t think they really ever caught on the significance of, you know—we were having so much
    richer a life there at Koinonia without all the glitz and glimmer of materialistic kind of things. [Laughs] But I don’t
    think they ever appreciated it.

EC: [Laughs]

JB: .[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: .

LD: And then— yeah, so I don’t think they ever really appreciated our new lifestyle, our new focus on life. But to us, it
    was just thrilling. We felt like we were on the cutting edge of something really significant.

EC: Yeah.

LD: And I mostly did work in the office, with the pecan workers and the mailing lists and interfaced with—we were kind of,
    like I say, it was very—a small group of people when we moved there. But very quickly, with these new initiatives,
    volunteers were coming in, a lot of them from the North. It was the hippie movement, you know, long hair, tattered jeans.
    And it was a time when people were questioning institutions and the way things were done traditionally. And they felt real
    challenge there and getting new direction on, you know, what was really right and getting their lives sort of at a point
    where they felt more comfortable, where they could move forward with the society.But we would go into town. I remember
    nobody had a car. We shared a car. We had to reserve a car if we wanted to go into town. But we would shop, you know, in the
    grocery stores. And people would look at me, and they’d say, “You’re new here in town, aren’t you?” And I’d say,
    “Yes.” “Well, where do you live?” And when I said, “Koinonia,” you know, it was like [laughing] they couldn’t
    get away from me fast enough! It was like I was a leper, you know.And I experienced that time after time. But it didn’t
    bother me a whole lot, because I knew we were doing the right thing. And I felt sorry for them, that they misunderstood or
    didn’t understand the true nature of what we were doing. We never were beat up. But before we were there, back in the
    fifties, there were residents of Koinonia that were beat up.I can remember hearing about a story of Conrad Brown was walking
    down the street with a guy, and they were sharing a bag of peanuts, walking with one of the black residents of Koinonia, and
    they were both arrested. They were arrested! I mean, that was just a no-no, to be walking down the street, [laughs] sharing
    a bag of peanuts! Now, we did have a pretty harrowing experience. There was a young man, a family in Unadilla, Georgia.
    That’s about thirty or forty miles east of here, just across the Interstate 75. And this young man wanted to be a doctor,
    physician. And he knew that going to black schools—the schools were still segregated at that time. He knew that the
    education he was getting in his school wasn’t going to ever get him into med school. So, he applied—he challenged the
    system in that rural town. He wanted to get into the high school, the white high school. And, boy, that hit the news!We
    heard about it. It was on TV and the newspapers. We decided that we needed to go over there and show some support to the
    family and encourage them, you know, that what they were doing were right. So, Millard and I and Faith— Faith, she was
    still in diapers, and she’s the one who did the documentary on Koinonia—

EC: Yeah.

JB: Hold that up so we can see better.

LD: [Laughs] Okay.

JB: Tell what it is.

LD: Yeah. This is an hour-long documentary entitled Briars in the Cotton Patch that our daughter, Faith Fuller, produced back in
    the early 2000s. It was released in 2003, and she’s just done a tenth anniversary update of Briars. And it’s been shown
    on public television in every state in the nation, and it’s been shown during times like Black History Month, things like
    that. She realized as an adult that the story of Koinonia—here’s a picture of Clarence Jordan right here with a bunch of
    peanuts that he just got out of the field. She realized that the story had never really been told about—there had been
    books written, articles in newspapers and magazines, but there never had been a significant documentary of that story.And
    she took it on herself to produce this documentary, and she had never done a documentary before. It took her about three
    years. She did the research, she raised the money. As I recall, she needed about fifty thousand dollars to do all that
    needed—you know, there’s [laughs] as you probably understand, a lot of people don’t understand, it takes a lot of
    things other than just filming and editing film, in actually producing a film. There’s a lot that has to take place, along
    with that. So, we’re very proud that she did that.

JB: 

LD: It was founded by Clarence and Florence Jordan, and Martin and Mabel England, who only stayed about two or three years, I
    guess, but they were there in the very beginning. They basically started out with a poor plot of land, you know, red Georgia
    clay. And Clarence, being a graduate of the University of Georgia in agriculture, he loved farming. And so, he thought that,
    you know, that would be a good venue to start an intentional Christian community to live out the teachings of Jesus that he
    had studied about in seminary, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. He felt very strongly about
    this because, having grown up in a small South Georgia town, Talbotton, Georgia, he saw the discrimination. He had friends
    who were black friends that he could play with, but they couldn’t go in his house, for instance. They couldn’t go into
    his school. He saw the restrictions there on his little friends at a very early age, and he began to question whether that
    was right or wrong. And then, of course, when he became a Greek New Testament scholar and read the original Greek, he could
    see that what he was reading there didn’t match up with the culture that he was raised in. And he wanted to experiment
    with these, what were pretty different principles—as you know, because that’s why the Civil Rights Movement was
    generated, because of all the injustices. [Clears throat]And it was—the first few years were pretty much establishing the
    farm, getting housing. I know that Florence and Clarence had a baby, and she lived with his parents in Talbotton the first
    couple of years, because there was no running water. I mean, it would have been very difficult for them to have the children
    there. But, you know, they established the traditions of a Christian community, sharing the noon meals—well, actually, I
    think they shared lunch and dinner at that time, a meal in common in the dining room. They held worship services. All of it
    was done in very simple structures. There was no actual church building.In fact, Clarence said [laughs] a guy came along in
    his Cadillac one day. Clarence was—he was a very good mechanic, too. He happened to be under a tractor, repairing a motor,
    and he was all greasy, overalls, things like that. And so, he got up, you know, from under the tractor, and kind of wiped
    off his hands, and extended them for a handshake. And then the guy said, “I’m out here. I want to see if you are really
    a Christian community like you say you are. And I don’t see a church anywhere! You couldn’t be a Christian community!”
    [Laughs]

EC: Well. [Laughs] Where did the other families and other people who ended up living at Koinonia come from? Were they local to
    the area, or did most people come from outside?

LD: Most people came from outside. I think it was kind of rare for us to be Southerners and live there.

EC: Yeah. Was that true of the black families, as well as the white? 

LD: Most—all of the black families were local. They were from that county, pretty much. One of the reasons why it had gotten
    down to such small numbers when we moved there in 1968 is because the black families were threatened. Now, some kind of
    organized and moved up North, New York, I think. They established another Koinonia community up North, but I think it kind
    of fizzled out after a while.But the black families that stayed, they were threatened, to the point where they said, “If
    you continue to go to Koinonia, we’re going to burn your house down.” Or, “We’re going to kill members of your
    family.” I mean, really serious threats! And they—the lady who worked in the candy kitchen at Koinonia, Ms. Gussie
    Jackson, this happened way before we moved there, but they threatened to burn her house down, and they did! They set it on
    fire, and she was at home at the time. And she went running out and fell on her knees and prayed to God to put out that
    fire. And it went out!

EC: Really?

LD: [Laughs] But I don’t know that they were ever successful in burning down any of the houses, but it scared people so badly
    that they kind of just drifted away.

EC: Yeah. And this in the fifties and sixties, probably?

LD: Yeah, I would say late fifties.

EC: Yeah. So, were most of the black families that were involved with Koinonia, they didn’t live on the property?

LD: Some did, some didn’t.

EC: Okay.

LD: Some still worked for farmers, doing the seasonal crops. And then, in the wintertime, when we needed help in the pecan and
    fruitcake and candy kitchen, they would come and have temporary employment there. But, you know, by the time we got there,
    there were still people that were afraid to associate too closely with Koinonia. As long as they just were going there for a
    job, that was kind of different.

EC: That was okay?

LD: Yeah. And a few would come and join us for a community lunch sometimes, but they were still nervous about those threats that
    were made years earlier. 

EC: Yeah. You said that—you were telling a story about, you said, a harrowing experience where the black student in Unanita,
    Georgia—?

LD: Oh! I never did finish that story, did I?

EC: No.

LD: In Unadilla.

EC: Unadilla?

LD: Unadilla, Georgia. Okay. So, it was about this time of year or a little earlier. I remember there was an older guy that had
    a big strawberry patch, and we’d just picked bowls full of strawberries that morning. So, we thought it would be a nice
    thing to do to take the family some strawberries. So, it was Millard and me and Faith. Yeah, I know how we got
    sidetracked—on Briars in the Cotton Patch.

EC: Yeah.

LD: So, we get over there and we find the house, and no one was there. It was probably like about two o’clock. So, we figured,
    well, she’s off at work. I’ve forgotten the name of the family right now, but—and we figured, well, the kids are still
    at school. So, we sat on the front porch. And pretty soon, a few of the children came home from school, and they didn’t
    know us from Adam’s house cat. And so, we talked to them and told them why we were there and kind of let them know that we
    were friendly.Well, the mother hadn’t gotten home yet, but all of a sudden this police car comes roaring up. And the
    policeman got out of the car, and he had his gun. And he said, “What are you doing here at this nigger’s house?” And
    we said, “Well, we just came to visit.” And he said, “Well, don’t you know it’s against the city ordinance for
    whites to visit with niggers?” And we said—Millard said, he’s kind of a little smart aleck, but he said, “Well, no,
    but if you have such an ordinance, you know, it’s not worth the paper it’s written on.”

EC: [Laughs]

LD: Boy, did that make him mad! And he said, “Okay, you’re under arrest!” And I was still up on the porch, holding Faith
    in my arms. And Millard was down, you know, close to the policeman. And so, I said to myself, “I’m not going to let him
    take Millard off in his police car.” And so, I walked down and I said, “If my husband was doing something wrong, I was,
    too. You’ve got to arrest me, too!” [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs] And the baby. 

LD: Yeah! [Laughs] Okay, so he took us down to City Hall to the jail. And he said, “Okay, you sit over there. I’m going to
    call the City Commissioner, or the County Commissioner, and we’re going to have a meeting about this.” So, we sit there.
    We sit there. And I begin to think, “Oh, my gosh, if they lock us up, what am I going to use for diapers?” I mean, I
    didn’t bring any extra diapers. I thought, “Well, how am I going to manage this?”So, we sat there and we sat there.
    And Faith was toddling around. There was a piano in there. And she walked over and she starts playing the notes. And I go,
    “Shhh! Don’t! We don’t want to disturb them.” Millard said, “Oh, let her go ahead and make all the noise she
    wants!”

EC: [Laughs] 

LD: He was more ticked off than I was. [Clears throat] Well, it wasn’t long before they came out and they said, “Okay. Since
    this is only the first time you’ve done this, that we have record of this, we’re going to let you go for now. But—”
    and Millard heard this, but I didn’t even really understand what they were saying. He says, “But we’re not responsible
    for you.” Millard read that, you know, [laughs] they were going to come after us and try to do us harm. So, they said,
    “Okay, you can go.” We said, “Well, you brought us here. You’ve got to take us back to our car.” [Laughs]So,
    Millard said, “Okay.” He said, “We’re going to get out of here and we’re going to go to the first motel that we
    can find and check in.” And by the time we got there and registered and were walking in our room, we saw a van pull in
    with four men in the van. So, we got in the motel room. I didn’t know what to expect by then. So, I took Faith back into
    the bathroom. It was like your general motel rooms, where the bathrooms are always in the back. I thought, [laughing] “If
    they’re going to start shooting at us, maybe that would be the safest place.”Millard got on the phone. He called—he
    looked in the Yellow Pages at the churches. And so, the first church he called was the Episcopal church. He thought that
    maybe they would be the most sympathetic. And the rector answered, and Millard explained the situation, that we may be in a
    threatening position, and would he come over and help us. And he said, “Oh!” he said, “I promised the ladies that I
    would come and speak to their little tea this afternoon. I’m sorry. I cannot come.” Well, then I think he called a
    couple more churches. There was no answer.So, he thought, “I’m going to take my chances and call the sheriff of this
    county and see if he’ll come. So, apparently, he and the police chief weren’t such good friends, so he did come over.
    And, in fact, he got in touch with the FBI. Maybe they had had some incidents like this before.

EC: Yeah. 

LD: But he finally kind of calmed things down. We had called Clarence to come get us, to follow us home. But it was kind of
    scary.

EC: Did Koinonia—?

JB: [Recording stops and then resumes]

EC: You mentioned that back in Montgomery when Morris Dees and your husband were telling the Klansman that they weren’t going
    to subscribe anymore, that they pulled the pistol out. At Koinonia, did any of the residents ever use self-defense?

LD: No. There were no guns. I think they had one—I think Clarence had one gun in his house, but he would use it to, like, kill
    wild dogs or, you know, something like that. But they were totally against returning violence for violence.

EC: Very difficult in that context.

LD: In fact, at one point, when cars were riding by and shooting into the farm, sometimes bullets would narrowly escape kids
    that were playing outside. There are still today some bullet holes. In fact, the place where we were living, there was a
    bullet hole that came in and just barely missed one of the Jordan daughters. It shattered a mirror, but it missed her by
    inches. Nobody was ever killed.But they thought, well, you know, these are basically coward kind of folks, and they would
    take turns sitting out at the road at night, just to demonstrate that they weren’t afraid, and if they want to shoot, just
    go right ahead, you know.

EC: Yeah.

LD: And there’s a lot covered in, you know, in the documentary, the Briars documentary, about those kinds of incidents, and
    how the children felt about it. They were interviewed, and a lot more detail on that.

EC: Yeah. I’m looking forward to it, to seeing it. Where did your children go to school when you moved here? That must have
    been an interesting situation. 

LD: Well, we were out in the county, and at that time and for the longest time, until just recent years, there were two schools.
    There was the county school and the city school. And we were living in the county. Interestingly enough, when we got—well,
    let me just say this. When we first moved here, we only had two school-aged kids, and they went to a little school, a
    country school. And then, we went away to Africa, and the oldest two were in an American school in Kinshasa, and that was
    wonderful. [Laughs] That was a much better education than they were receiving here. When we came back, we had three in
    public school, and our youngest child, who was born at Koinonia, went to the child development center that we had started
    before we left.And interestingly enough, the daughter, Faith, that made the documentary, she was in class with Amy Carter.
    It was right at the end of the Carter campaign that we came back from Africa. And Faith and Amy were in fourth grade
    together. The school was over in Plains, where the Carters still live. But, yeah, there were Secret Service in the class.
    And they allowed Amy to go climb a tree and read, rather than play on the playground. That was kind of interesting.But the
    older two, Chris and Kim, went to high school at Plains. And they would come home from school, especially the daughter, who
    was in, what, ninth grade by this time, crying because the schools were just awful. And these were white schools! But the
    building had become in such disarray. It eventually became the Carter Museum in Plains, and a lot of restoration of that
    school took place. It’s a beautiful building now. But it was in horrible condition then. I know that she complained about
    bird droppings coming from the ceiling. And the teachers would just pretty much let them look at magazines and not much
    instruction going on.The quality of the schools greatly improved. That’s one of the things that encouraged us to move into
    town: the fact that Koinonia really didn’t want to be part of the worldwide movement, and then, we needed better schools
    for our kids. And they had better schools here in the city. So, they got a really good education here. When schools were
    integrated, I’d say, in the late seventies, the quality of education continued to be really good, to the point where all
    of our kids went to college, finished college. There are complaints that the education kids are getting here is not
    adequate, but any kid who wants to go to college, we have an excellent college here in Americus. We have a big technical
    college. So, even if, since we’re a small town here, we have good quality.

EC: Yeah. So, the schools didn’t integrate here until the late seventies?

LD: I believe that’s right. I don’t think they were integrated when we first came back from Africa. I think it was pretty
    soon after that.

EC: Yeah. Sort of nationally, one of the big moments was around 1970, when there was a big Supreme Court decision that said you
    can’t operate separate schools in the same district, and I wondered if that had an impact around here? 

LD: Well, it takes—took a while! [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs] Moved a little slow?

LD: It moved pretty slowly. I could be wrong.

EC: I’m just curious.

LD: I don’t think they were integrated in 1976 when we came back from Africa, but I think it was a short time after that.

EC: After that, yeah. Did you know much about the Civil Rights Movement in Americus after you moved here, or did you hear much
    about it?

LD: Other than what—the stories at Koinonia. That was pretty much, I don’t know if I can term it a hot spot, or that was
    where a lot of transformation occurred, at Koinonia. I heard more about what happened in the general area after we had been
    here a while. We have a wonderful historian—his name is Alan Anderson—who has studied the history of Sumter County from
    the very beginning. And he wrote a book. He’s got a lot of details about those kinds of things.

EC: You know, one of the things that Americus is kind of infamous for, I guess, is the little girls that were arrested and put
    in jail. This would have been before you were here, but I wondered if something like that is part of a consciousness of the
    community.

LD: I met one of them!

EC: Did you?

LD: Yeah. I can’t remember her name, but I met one of them, who was arrested.

EC: Yeah. Is that something that people in the area—I’m also interested in historic memory, so I’m sort of wondering,
    like, how—you know, like in the community that I grew up in, I’m sort of interested in how people understand the past.
    And so, I wonder if it’s something that people around here think about or talk about much?

LD: I remember now where I met her. Koinonia had a celebration of its—the seventy-fifth anniversary at Koinonia was last
    year.

EC: Oh, okay. 

LD: And people came from all over that had lived at Koinonia at one time or the other. And I met a lot of these folks that I had
    heard stories about.

EC: Yeah.

LD: And, yeah, it was really interesting. Oh! I can tell you about an incident that happened in 1965 that I had forgotten
    about.

EC: Alright.

LD: That was when we came to visit some friends of ours. He had been kicked out of his church in Birmingham, Alabama, for
    proposing, you know, that they should be more welcoming to black people. And so, he was—he came over to Koinonia to live.
    I mean, they were just [laughs] really out, really didn’t know what to do. And so, we—he had actually preached in our
    little church that we started in our home in Montgomery, Alabama.And we came to visit them. And this was right after we
    decided to leave business and give away our money and we were looking for new direction. So, we decided to look the Henrys
    up, Carol and Al Henry, and that’s when we first met Clarence. And we were so amazed at Koinonia and its history, and the
    simple lifestyle was appealing to us then, because we were getting rid of all our material possessions and wealth. We stayed
    a month, instead of two hours.

EC: [Laughs]

LD: A month! [Laughs]

EC: Oops!

LD: Yeah. And so, that was December.

EC: Yeah?

LD: Almost all of December of 1965. Well, Carol Henry’s father was head of the Georgia Baptist Convention or—yeah, I think
    it was, that’s what it was. And he had been invited to speak at a Christmas church service at night at First Baptist
    Church in Americus, which was totally segregated, this total white congregation. And so, he came out to visit his daughter,
    had lunch with us, and he said, “You know, I’m preaching tonight. I want to invite all of you to come.” Well, you
    know, here we were, an integrated group. And so, we had a little discussion about that in the afternoon. And Clarence said,
    “Well, we’ve been invited. We ought to go, whoever wants to go.” So, we loaded up in several cars. There were probably
    about twenty of us, Clarence, Millard and me, Collins McGee—he was the only black person that would go with us. All the
    rest were—Al and Carol Henry, and some of the other residents of Koinonia.So, we started filing in. A big crowd was coming
    into First Baptist Church on Lee Street in Americus. So, we were kind of single file. And the deacons were passing out
    programs for the service. And when a black hand reached out to take one of the programs, you know, it was like [laughs]
    what?!

EC: Yeah.

LD: But, I mean, things continued. We all got in and we occupied one full pew. And so, we were settling in, and there were
    several little ladies on the pew in front of us. And they looked back and they started whispering, and then, they got up and
    they moved somewhere else. Same thing happened to the people that were seated behind us. They got up and moved somewhere
    else. So, here we were, like an island [laughs] on this one pew in the church. And they started singing a Christmas hymn.
    Oh, gosh, what was that ? I’ll think of it in a minute.Anyway, along comes the head deacon, who happened to be the fire
    chief in town. And he comes in and he grabs ahold of Collins McGee and he says, “You’ve got to get out of here!” And
    Clarence said, “Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We were invited to come here.” He said, you know, “We’re here to
    worship with you, to have, to enjoy this service with you.” And he said, “That’s beside the point! You can stay, but
    he’s got to get out of here,” you know, jerking on Collins’ arm. And Clarence said, “Never mind, never mind.” He
    said, “If you don’t want Collins here, we’re gonna all leave.” And so, we all got up and we left.So, there were a
    few deacons that came and talked to Clarence and Millard and a few others, and said, “What are you doing bringing this
    nigger into our church?! Don’t you know that we don’t allow that?!” And so, Clarence said, “Well, sir, I thought
    this was God’s church, and God is no respecter of persons.” He said, “We didn’t come here to do harm.” He said,
    “That’s beside the point!” [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs]

LD: “The federal government doesn’t own this church! We own this church!” And so, you know, we left. And it was
    interesting. As we walked out to the sidewalk, Clarence—I never will forget. I can remember seeing him do this today. He
    turned around and he looked at the church, big white columns, and there were floodlights, you know, just beaming on this
    church building. And Clarence made the remark, “Just look a’there at all that light on the outside, and it’s dark on
    the inside.” There were times when we lived at Koinonia that groups came in. I have pictures about those incidences where
    we had black visitors that wanted to attend church in town, so Clarence and Millard and a few others would go with them. But
    they were armed. The deacons were armed during that time. Now, since then, there’s been a huge change.

EC: Yeah?

LD: Blacks are welcome at almost any church here in town. There’s been a huge change.

EC: Do you know how that came about?

LD: Well, I guess the culture began to change as the old generations began to die off. And some of the laws changed. I mean,
    some of the—of course, you couldn’t really force churches to make that change. Clarence often says, “You know,
    everything’s integrated except the jails and the churches, and I have hope for the jails.” [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs] Well?

LD: But, you know, it just happened over time. I’d like to think that Habitat’s ministry developing here in Americus had
    something to do with it, because we had people coming in from all over the United States, some people from different
    countries in the world. And I think it helped to broaden people’s ideas of who God’s children were.

EC: I wondered how the local community felt and feels about Habitat and the work that you’ve done.

LD: Well, at first, you know, it was uncomfortable. I remember when we bought a house in town on Church Street, we moved into
    town from Koinonia, and our kids started going out and playing with the children in the neighborhood. And when they learned
    that we had moved into town from Koinonia, they didn’t allow their kids to play with our kids anymore for a while. And we
    had broken glass on our driveway most every morning when we would wake up, and I’d just go sweep it in my dustpan. But
    there were two tragedies that happened within a week after we moved in. One was a huge house that had been on the market
    that had just sold, like a big three-story mansion of a house, caught fire about a block down from where we lived. Millard
    was away on a speaking engagement. And I woke up during the night and I heard all these car doors slamming. Oh, my goodness!
    [Laughs] You know? Now, not only do we have broken glass on our driveway, but, you know, there’s some action being taken
    here. So, I didn’t turn on any light and I tiptoed to the front window. And I looked out and was relieved to see that
    these pickup trucks, people that were getting out of the pickup trucks were hurrying down the street. And then, I looked and
    saw the big fire. So, I breathed a sigh of relief there.But then, word began to spread, you know, that we were starting work
    kind of like what we had at Koinonia, and now it was in Americus, Georgia, and some hippie-kind of people were coming, you
    know, volunteers. And [sighs] there was very little understanding of what we were trying to do to eradicate poverty housing.
    And there were some really bad areas. Most—a lot of the streets had not been paved, just terrible shacks.And so, you know,
    we got organized. We not only started work here in Americus, but we were starting down in South Florida, in Immokalee, where
    a lot of migrant workers were. We were starting work in Appalachia, also on John’s Island, South Carolina, where there was
    a lot of poverty. People were getting in touch with us, because they had heard through Koinonia newsletters and the
    newsletters that we were producing, you know, that we were spreading this idea and that we were willing to come help them
    get started.[Sighs] But I think there were two things that really changed and opened people’s hearts here in Americus,
    Georgia. One was there were a lot of seniors, all ages, that were coming here to help us, that were volunteers at Habitat,
    and they would go to the local churches and they would begin to explain what we were all about. Then, when we started having
    blitz-builds, like building ten, twenty houses in a week’s time, and we had hundreds of people coming to work on those
    projects. And we started involving the local churches, getting them to sponsor a half of a house, and a few of them came out
    and volunteered. The idea began to catch on, and people began to see, really, what we were all about, that we were trying to
    put God’s love in action to really help people.

EC: How were you able to get the first churches locally to get onboard?

LD: Well, some really nice people, mostly from up North, would start attending the churches, and they would make friends. And
    then, they would invite their friends to come and participate that week. And, you know, a week, that wasn’t very
    threatening, so they would do it.

EC: Sure. 

LD: But I think the thing that really changed the climate the business community. They saw where our volunteers came and bought
    a lot of groceries, [laughs] a lot of this and a lot of that, you know. So, it was a boost for the economy. Plus, we were
    bringing in—we were employing people, too, permanent people who were buying houses, you know. And the business people
    began to be, you know, more supportive.We were bringing in—our first year of Habitat, we raised about seventy thousand.
    Nobody knew about it, you know. It was a real struggle in the early years. Before the Carters got involved, really, in 1984,
    it was a real struggle to raise money. And then, right before we left Habitat in 2005, commonly a quarter of a million or
    more dollars would come in every day.

EC: Every day.

LD: Every day. We had work in a hundred countries and had over nine hundred employees .

EC: Were they mostly in Americus or—?

LD: Yeah, yeah. And then, after we left, the board made the decision to move Habitat headquarters to Atlanta.

EC: So, that must have had an impact on the Americus economy.

LD: It sure did.

EC: Oh.

LD: It did, unfortunately.

EC: Yeah. When you would have—when you would do the blitz builds and so, you’d have people come in for a week or something,
    where would they be staying?

LD: Oh, well, some of them stayed in private homes, and that kind of helped spread the word, too.

EC: I wondered about—yeah, yeah. 

LD: Sometimes they bunked down in churches, or sometimes the college. They were on break and made dormitory rooms available. So,
    that helped to educate the community, too, getting them involved. And they could see what a difference it was making in the
    lives of families! The kids started doing better in school. I remember I had a teacher, who told me—we were in the grocery
    store, and she said, “Wow!” She said. “It’s amazing the difference in the student in my class since they moved into
    a Habitat home, better behaved and better grades.” And so, it was those kind of experiences that helped people to see that
    we were really on to something here. [Laughs]

EC: Yeah, nothing like having a decent standard of living, right?

LD: Decent standard of living, yeah!

EC: You know, when you were talking about those discussions, I think, in 1968, about sort of what direction, and when you moved
    to Koinonia and developed the housing and the economic development, it seems like, you know, roughly at the same time, in
    that same era, there’s a whole coop movement going on and there’s all sorts of programs that are partly coming out of
    the Civil Rights Movement and partly related to the war on poverty. Are you part of these larger conversations? Is that
    influencing the thinking that you all were involved in at the time in the work you were doing?

LD: Well, certainly, we tried to keep our focus on housing. There were temptations to broaden our ministry into other areas. But
    we were certainly working side by side with other organizations, other efforts to build awareness of needs of humanity, not
    only here in the United States, but around the world.

EC: Where did your international interest come from, do you know?

LD: Well, our goal right from the beginning was to eliminate poverty housing in the world. Right after we had left Montgomery,
    left business, we decided that we wanted to visit missionaries in Africa. And we had United Church of Christ, which was
    Millard’s church that he was raised in, to arrange a tour. Actually, they had asked him to do this, to visit missionaries
    and come back and tell about what he saw, and to raise money and awareness of mission work. But he turned them down because
    he figured it would cost him too much. [Laughs] It’d slow him down on his first million too much! So, we decided that that
    was one of the first things we wanted to do. And it was a six-week trip. Got grandparents to take care of the kids, and we
    went to five countries in Africa. And, as it turned out, we went back to one of the places we visited.

EC: Which countries did you go on that first trip? 

LD: We went to Tanzania, what was then Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana, and what was then called the Congo.
    When we lived there in the seventies, it was Zaire, and now it’s Congo again, the Democratic Republic of Congo.

EC: Yeah, right. How did you decide to go back to Congo/Zaire?

LD: Well, you know, when we visited there, the church wanted to reinstitute a business that a Belgian businessman had started,
    and somehow or another, the church had acquired it. But the dump truck was worn out, and several other aspects of the
    concrete block business had just broken down. So, Millard promised that he would come back home and raise money to buy them
    a new dump truck. So, we had that connection there.And so, when we started thinking about where we could build houses, we
    thought of that place, you know, and what a perfect place. The church invited us to come and help with the economy . We
    thought, well, we’ll just make concrete blocks and build houses. So, it was just kind of a natural—well, we feel like it
    was a God-given thing, you know, that evolved.

EC: How did it influence you to live outside the country for that long, you know, and take your children?

LD: Well, I don’t know. I’ve always been adventuresome.

EC: Yeah.

LD: I told you that my parents were in the appliance business. And we went to Florida one week out of the year, and that’s it!
    [Laughs] I didn’t go anywhere else. So, I was interested in seeing other parts of the world. That trip that we made when I
    was twenty-five years old to Africa, it broadened my horizons a lot. And it just—and Millard was adventuresome, too, you
    know. We had learned how to live simply, learned how to make yogurt, make bread, all those kind of things at Koinonia, so it
    was kind of a good training ground for being a missionary.

EC: Yeah. [Laughs]

LD: Plus, my own simple upbringing. My mother taught me to sew and to cook, you know. We were good at surviving most anywhere,
    you know. So, we just—we had this vision, and any time we’d go to a new country or a new place, we’d read books and,
    you know, we tried to understand the culture. And we built what we called appropriate technology—we used appropriate
    technologies to keep the cost of the houses down, whatever the style house, whatever materials were available in that area,
    and, you know, doing a lot of manual labor so that we wouldn’t have machines breaking down. And we enjoyed visiting
    families. In fact, many times, we would stay with families that had moved into a Habitat house. Sri Lanka, South Korea,
    Fiji. Families thought it was kind of interesting, you know, that the founders and the president and his wife of Habitat for
    Humanity would want to stay in their little humble abode. But we took great joy, because that gave us inspiration for
    wanting to provide that for more and more families.

EC: Um-hmm. I was listening to those countries you listed. Some of those had just been through anti-colonial movements, or had
    just sort of—and some were still colonial countries.

LD: Um-hmm.

EC: Did you have a sense of that at the time or notice any differences?

LD: Hmm, that’s an interesting question. Of course, that was certainly the case in Zaire. Now, Congo—the Belgian—they had
    won their independence, actually, right about the same time we visited for the first time in 1965. So, it was
    still—because of independence, you know, most of the Belgian business people had left. The Catholic Church and foreign
    missionaries were there. But it was a time when a few populations had come into the cities to find work. They were now free.
    They didn’t have to stay out of the city. They no longer had to have a car to move around. So, they were just flooding
    into the cities, which made the housing situation just overwhelming. We built a hundred and twenty houses, but that was just
    a drop in the bucket.

EC: Yeah

LD: See, after we left, though, more and more houses—

EC: It continued?

LD: It continued and it spread. It spread into other parts of Zaire and other, . Now, I guess that would also apply to South
    Africa. They were still—apartheid was strong back in 1965 and also when we started work there. But we started work in the
    townships first of all. And there were other programs where there was job training and opportunities for people to start
    little industries, and that way they could afford to make the payments for our Habitat houses.So, it was a way to liberate,
    get people out from underneath the oppression, just like we did at Koinonia.

EC: Yeah. 

LD: Oh, we had farmers to come and—I know we were just—almost finished with a house, family about ready to move in, and here
    comes a farmer on his horse! It had rained, and he just went round and round and round on his horse, and he just made a mess
    of the front yard. He was mad.And there was another instance where Ethel had worked in the kitchen, done housework for a
    farmer and his wife. And they found out that they were going to move and have a house of their own and move off of their
    farm. And they cut off their water! They had to haul water in barrels for several months while their house was under
    construction. And to beat all, that woman had enough nerve to come and ask Ethel to bake cakes for them at Christmas!

EC: [Laughs] She miscalculated maybe?

LD: And they never turned the water back on. She asked them to, but they never did. [Clears throat] Excuse me. But she told me,
    she said, “You know, I baked those cakes.” She said, “I had to show them that I was bigger than them.”

EC: But they never came around?

LD: Not that I know of.

EC: You mentioned a few minutes ago a church in your home in Montgomery that you started. Can you tell us about that?

LD: When we moved to Montgomery, we wanted to go to a church. Millard grew up in a Congregational church. It eventually became
    United Church of Christ when the Congregational merged with Evangelical and Reform churches. And he said, “Well, there
    isn’t a Congregational church here in Montgomery. Let’s start one.” So, we started it in our home and, you know, we
    built it up to about twenty people. And then, we found a—we actually started meeting in the chapel of Huntington College.
    They let us do that on Sunday morning for a while. And then, we built a little building on the outskirts of Montgomery, a
    church out there.

EC: Were you just lay ministers then? Or did you have a minister?

LD: No, we didn’t like—oh, well, we eventually hired one, but Al Henry was one of our visiting ministers until we hired a
    full-time minister. Back then they [Laughs]

JB: 

LD: Anyway, there is a book that Millard wrote. Actually, he was pretty good at writing diaries when he was in business. He kept
    a record of what was happening every day, and he would record other things that he was involved in, like developing the
    church, he helped to get property, and things like that. And I guess we were the largest donors in the congregation until we
    left. [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs]

LD: Ten percent, no. Not even one percent.

EC: Yeah.

LD: But we say that after we left, the church died. So, our church membership died and went to heaven. And we didn’t join
    another church until we joined Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains. Jimmy Carter twisted our arm and said, “Okay, I joined
    Habitat. Now, I want you to join our church.” So, we did. [Laughs]Well, let’s see, now. Where were we? I think I got a
    little off track.

EC: Oh, I just asked you about that church. I was actually—in your biography and some of these high points that you put
    together, which was very helpful, you mention some of the law cases that your husband Millard was involved with, you said,
    sort of representing some African Americans who were seeking employment in law enforcement. And then, you mention here
    something about a black boycott in Americus in 1971. Can you tell us about some of that?

LD: Um-hmm. Yeah. When we were living at Koinonia, we became aware of some pretty serious police brutality against black people.
    And at that time, the police force and the sheriff, county law enforcement also, was totally segregated—all white. Well,
    the schools were, you know, soon to integrate. But anyway, it was a real kind of volatile time, and changes were taking
    place. But the law enforcement was totally white. And there were some black people that wanted to get employed. And things
    just kind of came to a head when there was so much brutality against black people and very unfair administration of
    enforcement of laws.So, the black people just rebelled. They kind of stood up and said, “This has got to stop!” And when
    it didn’t, then they said, “Okay, well, we’re not going to do any business in town. If we have to, we’ll go to
    neighboring communities to buy our groceries.” And so, that got the attention. That got the attention. There was a march
    in downtown Americus. And we actually—I participated in that, as well as Millard. We walked down the street. There was not
    a car. Everybody stayed in the stores. People were peering out the windows. I mean, [laughs] everybody was afraid, you know,
    that riots were going to break out. But we wanted it to be a peaceful march. We just wanted to show determination and
    demonstrate how serious .I can remember so well there was a meeting called in one of the churches, black churches. And
    Millard was asked to speak. And everybody was just so riled up. And Millard started speaking in his usual, you know,
    enthusiastic kind of tone. And he realized that he had to calm himself down, because the crowd was about to lose it. And he
    was able to calm things down and to have a focus on what would actually bring about change.And he said, “Some of you black
    folks ought to step up and apply for some of these jobs.” So, when they did, of course, they were turned down. But then,
    they were able to file a law case on that, so they eventually—some of them got hired. And then, and then there was a woman
    that wanted to get on the force. Here again, you know. [Laughs] Oh, and they used the excuse, “Oh, she’s too pretty.”

EC: [Laughs]

LD: You know, “This might distract the men from doing their jobs.” And Millard said, “That won’t wash. That will not
    wash.” And so, he got her hired. [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs]

LD: But then, also, he became aware of the tremendous injustices as far as tort cases, death penalty, murder cases, for blacks
    accused of murder. And he began to get involved in taking some of those what we call death penalty or death row cases. And
    even if it was obvious that someone was guilty—it was really bad if they had killed a white person. That was almost
    certain death penalty.And all the juries were pretty much white. And Millard figured out why, or else in his partnering with
    people like Millard Farmer in Atlanta, who was also doing a lot of the death cases, they discovered that black folks did not
    believe in the death penalty, because they knew that it worked against black people. So, when there was the selection of the
    jury, all an attorney had to do was to ask, “Do you believe in the death penalty,” and they would say, “No.” And
    they would never get selected. So, therefore, you had an all-white jury, and it was easy to persuade them to come back with
    a verdict of guilty and, you know, they wanted to call for the death penalty.So, Millard was very persuasive. He was just
    great in a courtroom. [Laughs] And he took great pride in getting a jury to pray with him one time. 

EC: [Laughs]

LD: He wanted them, you know, to focus in on, you know, “Is this really what God would want you to—?” [Laughs] This was
    before the days when courthouses were air conditioned. And about after lunch, you know, things would get—it was hard for
    the jury, the persons on the jury to stay awake. And he would wait for one of them to nod off, you know, like this. And
    he’d start saying, “This is a serious matter, somebody’s life, you know. And if you’re a Christian, you need to
    really consider whether you should sentence this person to death.” And he said, “It’s so serious, we need to pray
    about this.” He said, “Let’s bow our heads.” And he’d look over to the one that was sound asleep and say, “Thank
    you,” you know. [Laughs] And then, people would think he was already praying, and so they’d bow their heads.

EC: [Laughs]

LD: [Laughs] I tell you, whatever it took, he was able to—to bring justice. A lot of the times, it would involve a life
    sentence, but at least he kept people off of death row.

EC: Did he ever work with Donald Hollowell on any of those cases? Do you know? Donald Hollowell? He was a black lawyer from
    Atlanta. He ended up working with the EEOC, I think, at a certain point. But I think he was involved—it might have been
    involved in a different era, slightly, but I think he was involved in trying to fight some of the inequities in the death
    penalty cases in Georgia, too. 

LD: That name does not sound familiar. Millard practiced law until Habitat got so big that he just didn’t have the time for it
    anymore. I thought it was a shame, because he was so good. At one point, he partnered with a lawyer in Columbus, who did
    most of the preparation and the depositions on a case. And then, a couple of days before, he would inform Millard of the
    facts and everything, and then, Millard actually was lead lawyer in the case. But he had to give it up, because Habitat was
    just growing at such a phenomenal rate.

EC: Yeah. That is pretty extraordinary. You know, it was interesting for me to read more of the history, because I guess I grew
    up with the idea of Habitat as this well-established, you know, organization. I learned more about how it was founded, so
    interesting, you know, to think of it as always well-established, you know, and so successful. There was something I was
    thinking about, and now it’s—.What was it like to participate in that march? Were you the only whites, or among the only
    whites in that march you were mentioning in Americus?

LD: We weren’t the only whites. I think there were some other people from Koinonia that participated. 

EC: But primarily Koinonia, not—?

LD: Yeah, uh-huh.

EC: Yeah. What was it—I mean, did you have any fear or any concerns about being a part of the march?

LD: Um, yeah, a little bit.

EC: Right.

LD: But, you know, I knew what I was doing was right. And by that time, we had lived at Koinonia for a good long while, having
    moved there in ’68, and the march was ’71. Um, I—it was just that we were taught to do what you feel in your heart is
    right. And if you get harmed or get put in jail or even lose your life, you know, you’ve done the right thing. Take a
    stand for something.

EC: How do you think the Civil Rights Movement and your—I mean, it’s obvious that your Christian faith is clearly
    significant. Does that intersect with the Civil Rights Movement in the ways that you and Millard chose to focus your lives?

LD: Oh, absolutely, you know. It was part of what was the most prevalent at that time in history. It was the most obvious thing
    that needed to be changed.

EC: Yeah. Were there things that you missed about your old life?

LD: [Laughs] No. [Laughs] Not really.

EC: Yeah. Did you lose friends who were part of the sort of white society?

LD: I’d say I gained a whole lot more friends than I lost. Oh, yeah. That’s an understatement, yeah. It was our families
    that were disgusted, really, disappointed. We were shunned by most of our family members, on my side of the family and
    Millard’s side of the family. They just didn’t get it. They didn’t understand why we were running counter to the
    culture. In fact, there were a few, when we left business and gave our money away, they said, “You need to be in a mental
    institute,” [laughs] giving up all that money. But it was like what was holding us back from a real life, and it destroyed
    our marriage. We just wanted to gun it and start totally over.

EC: Was it hard to deal with your family feelings? 

LD: Yeah. Yeah, it was. My mother didn’t want to discuss anything that was controversial. And we tried to have discussions
    with my dad, and we just finally gave up. [Sighs] We just kept it on our family and grandkids and, you know.

EC: What about your sister?

LD: My sister was very supportive. When she and her husband married a couple of years before we did, Millard and I, they had
    moved to California. And that was sort of one of the hearts of liberal thinking out there. So, yeah, I should have made a
    mention of that, but my sister certainly was accepting.

EC: It seems interesting that, then, Morris Dees also sort of seems to follow a similar path, I guess, in founding the Southern
    Poverty Law Center.

LD: Um-hmm, exactly. Yeah. He started off—I think one of his first things was to integrate the Alabama State Patrol, something
    like that.

EC: That’s a challenge, yeah.

LD: That was a big deal.

EC: I’m sure.

LD: And then, he got more into representing people who had been harmed by the Klan or other subversive groups. His support
    greatly expanded and diversified to other minority groups.

EC: Um-hmm. Does that go back to that same incident with the Freedom Ride?

LD: I never asked him that question, but I would certainly think so.

EC: Did he stay in touch with you all? Or do you think he was influenced by the decisions that you all made?

LD: I don’t know. We didn’t have much contact. We were really busy into Koinonia and Africa and work with Habitat. And he
    was kind of doing his thing, you know. And once in awhile our paths would cross, but there wasn’t a whole lot of contact
    there.

EC: Yeah. Kind of interesting the trajectory there.

LD: Um-hmm. 

EC: I haven’t talked—I mean, I haven’t asked you a lot of questions about Habitat, because I think it’s more documented,
    but are things that we haven’t talked about that that you think are particularly significant, or you’d like to focus on,
    with Habitat or anything else?

LD: Hmm. Well, I don’t think so. If I had some time to reflect from now on back at a later time, I might, but nothing comes to
    mind.

JB: 

LD: [Laughs] Well, it is. It is. It kind of all fits together. Everybody had their own piece of the puzzle, you know, putting it
    in at different times. It finally began to make sense, and we began to make changes within the society. But it was very,
    very slow. Like, you know, any kind of major change in society, it takes a long, long time. But the thing that has been very
    interesting is the Civil Rights Movement has spurred so many other freedom movements outside the , with women, with other
    minorities, even with the mentally ill, you know. The Civil Rights Movement proved that people could speak out and
    demonstrate another way, and eventually get to people’s hearts and minds and make real change happen. But sometimes, you
    know, it takes years to put all those pieces together. And I think that, to put it in religious terms, we’re all called to
    different pieces of that puzzle.And it was always interesting to me to see how people kind of group together: “We’ll
    work on this.” “We’ll work on that.” “We’ll do this, and we’ll do that, you know,” you know, and just how it
    all evolved. And those patterns that were set on how the Civil Rights Movement unfolded is a great pattern, a great
    illustration, a great template on what kind of work it takes to make other change, whether it’s getting people to wear
    their seatbelt, [laughs] or, you know, provide healthcare, you know. There’s a lot of changes that are going on right now
    in our society. It just takes time. It takes people courageously speaking out, making sacrifices.

EC: So, are those some of the things that you think were most significant about the Civil Rights Movement, that being willing to
    take a stand and speak out?

LD: Oh, absolutely, people putting their lives on the line. I heard Andrew Young speak once, telling some of the stories. I can
    remember one, in particular, about the March on Birmingham, where they used the fire trucks—the fire hoses, and everybody
    just deciding to sit down. They hadn’t planned to do that. It’s just someone started sitting down as a gesture of being
    humble, and they eventually turned those hoses off.There are just some powerful stories. I can’t wait to see some of the
    other interviews. I know you’ve already—I’ve watched a couple that have already been posted on the website.

EC: Yeah. Well, I think it’s going to be a remarkable addition to our history, so I’m really glad that we were able to talk
    with you. 

LD: Well, at the beginning, I was more of an observer, kind of taking it all in, being educated by my husband’s experiences,
    opening up to a wider variety of people. And then, my contacts with people all over the United States and all over the
    world, and seeing that everybody, you know, has certain things in common, no matter where they are or what color skin or
    whatever culture they come in. I would relate to people even if I couldn’t speak their language. You know, I would make
    gestures towards their children, you know, and I could tell them a little bit about my children, you know, and people have
    grandchildren.I’ve heard similar things from the Carters, Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter, how they would relate to big important
    statesmen and stateswomen around the world, is to get down on a real common human level. And people really appreciate it. I
    mean, Millard was so good at this; when we would visit, he would make a fool out of himself dancing in Africa. [Laughs]

EC: [Laughs]

LD: Oh, he would just make the crowds go berserk, you know, because they had never seen a white man making a fool of himself
    before. They were accustomed to, you know, these stiff-shirt, ties, suit, dignitaries, you know, who kind of ordered them
    around. But we always enjoyed getting down on a real human level with people and making them know that we care about them.
    And I think that’s what’s going to change the world, make it a better place for everybody. We enjoyed it! I mean, that
    was—that became our life, meeting people and helping them to make a difference.

EC: Remarkable. How has it influenced your children?

LD: Oh, I think that it has greatly impacted them: the experience of us living at Koinonia, seeing a different way of life, a
    very meaningful and deeply religious, a rooted way of life, meeting people who were—some were very different, some people
    who were really weird, actually, but being able to accept everybody, no matter how different or where they came from, and
    then, the experience overseas, of three years in Africa. Our son, in seminary, applied for a job to work in Saudi Arabia, at
    ARAMCO. He was leading the kids of the Americans and Europeans in their summer activities when they were out of school. And
    he got that job, basically, because he had had international living experience. There were three others that applied, but he
    got the job because he had that. And they never meet a stranger. Some of our kids have been more engaged in worthwhile
    church and community activities. All four of them are, you know, their own person, and we never have tried to force them.
    They’ve been on builds with us. They’ve started student Habitat groups, or Habitat campus chapters they’re called.
    They’ve been involved with the effort that we started in 2005 after we left Habitat, the Fuller Center for Housing. And,
    you know, we have a daughter-in-law, who is actually on staff—helps raise money—for the Fuller Center. They’ve started
    a group in their community. Our daughter out in Texas, who is a homebuilder for very upscale housing, not like the ones that
    we build with Habitat and the Fuller Center, but they got her to lead a Habitat house in Benton, Texas. They’ve been
    involved in different ways, but, you know, they’ve had their education, their families, you know, raising their families,
    and they haven’t done it full time—

EC: Um-hmm, yeah.

LD: But each has done something in their own way, you know.

EC: Is there anything you’d like to add?

LD: I know there’s probably—

EC: I know it’s hard to think of everything, isn’t it?

LD: Some stories. Yeah. Like a restroom break!

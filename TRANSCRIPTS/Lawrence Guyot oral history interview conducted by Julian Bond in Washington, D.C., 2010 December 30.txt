MALE VOICE: Cameras rolling. Ready to roll.

INTERVIEWER: Mr. Guyot, thanks for doing this interview.

MR. GUYOT: It's a pleasure.

INTERVIEWER: Now you were born and grew up in Pass Christian, Mississippi, and you said that racial prejudice by and large did not affect
             you during your youth? How could that be so in Mississippi at that age in time?

MR. GUYOT: I came from the most non- Mississippi-like section of Mississippi. It was a heavy Catholic influence. Ingalls Shipyard was
           producing most of the major armaments for all hostilities in Pascagoula, hiring people from 63 counties. You had the labor
           union influence; you had the Catholic Church influence, which was tremendous; and you had a population of 100,000 white
           people, 19,000 black people.The Catholic Church in 1957 or '58 made a decision that they were going to desegregate the
           schools. They did it this way. The announcement was we have two programs. We have excommunication and we have integration.
           Make your choice by Friday. Now there was violence going on in Louisiana. Nothing happened on the Gulf Coast. I learned
           firsthand that institutions can really have an impact on social policy. I bought three slot machines, Julian, because there
           was a lot of gambling on the Gulf Coast. I just passed the academic test for entrance into Tougaloo College. I was going to
           be sent to jail by Gaston Hughes [phonetic]. My father hires Bidwell Adams to represent me. Bidwell Adams is the lieutenant
           governor under Bilbo. He is the chairman of the Democratic Party in the State of Mississippi, and he's a lawyer who
           represents black people who've beenaccused of raping white women.We go to his office and my father says here's the problem.
           Bilbo said, "Don't worry about it." He calls up Gaston Hughes. He said, "No, this boy is not black. He's a Creole." I didn't
           correct him, Julian. He then said, "This boy is going off to school. I don't want to hear anymore about these slot
           machines." Gaston said I'm going to send him to Parchman. Bilbo says okay. I looked at my father; we must be in the wrong
           place. He continued. He says, "Okay, but if I hear anymore about these slot machines, I'm going to call for a federal
           investigation of all gambling on the Gulf Coast, and I'm going to make sure that everyone knows that you caused it."At the
           time of this meeting I was 17 years old. I'm now 71 years of age. I've never heard about those slot machines and I've never
           heard about anyone who's heard about those slot machines, which drove home to me that all the life that we live is
           political.

INTERVIEWER: Back up a little bit. You're sitting in the office of Theodore Bilbo…

MR. GUYOT: No, of Bidwell Adams. 

INTERVIEWER: Bidwell Adams.

MR. GUYOT: Who is lieutenant governor when Bilbo was governor. I was born in Harrison County. Bilbo was born in Hancock County. Bidwell
           Adams after leaving the lieutenant governorship, then becomes a practicing lawyer and a loyal Kennedy Democrat. This is the
           guy who handled the patriots for the Democratic Party.I come out of a family--my grandfather's brother was chairman of the
           Republican Party in Hancock County for 65 years. He died at 105 years of age. His name is Louis Piernas. He and I talked
           about Randolph, who my high school was named after. He said, "I saw the civil war fought on the beaches of Bay St. Louis,
           not far from Waverley [phonetic] where we used to go down to meet." He talked about, "My wife and I did a genealogy study.
           We run across a WPA interview of him." He says, "Well, Bilbo is really terrible and I just hope that blacks will be able to
           fight there way into the Democratic Party." I got chills up my spine. I said, "That's what I've been doing."My family was
           very, very political. My grandfather was a man who taught me the value of listening. Long before communalism was what it is
           today, he had a lot of Baptist ministers as friends. They would meet outside every Sunday and they would decide what they
           would go in and convince him of. I knew who was going to win this argument. They would come out convinced that they had
           convinced my grandfather. They were satisfied that he understood them and he agreed with them. I knew that when I talked to
           him about it afterwards, that it had gone just the other way.He had one habit, Julian. If you went to him and said, "Mr.
           Joos [phonetic], I'm going fishing," he would repeat the word "fishing". I said, "Grandpa, you're too smart to do that. I've
           seen the people you talk to." He said, "Boy, it gives me a little bit more time to think about what I'm going to say. From
           that day on, Julian, I never questioned my grandfather. He and I read the newspaper together every day. We also listened to
           two people on the radio. Whenever FDR spoke, he gathered the family to listen to our president. Another guy was Ronald
           Reagan.

INTERVIEWER: Really? Why Reagan?

MR. GUYOT: Why Reagan? Because weliked his style. We didn't like his etiology, but we were impressed with how he did it. I mean he
           could paint the pictures.I'm 7 years old. He takes me in front of the Catholic Church in Mississippi in St. Philomena's. I
           read Paul's letters to the Galatians and Ephesians. I'm just proud. I'm with my grandfather; I can read before my
           congregation; I can do anything. I learned from my family the value of service and the interrelationship between religion
           and politics.My father was a man who would've made Lyndon Johnson look like a pica if he could've just gotten the kind of
           political opportunities that I had. My father got in a contest one time about a mathematics problem. Everyone in the town
           told him that he was wrong, that he had figured out wrong. They sent back to the book manufacturer and the book manufacturer
           said, "We made a mistake. He's right."He's a man who when he got into a jewelry, a woman wanted to get $6,000 from an
           insurance company. Everybody in the jewelry store said, "That…" My father said, "Send out and get a lot of coffee because
           until she gets her $6,000, we're not going to decide anything.I saw my father, Julian, beat one of the richest men in Pass
           Christian almost to a pulp in front of the post office with his fist and then take me by the hand and walk me home. I come
           from a city that as the Catholic Church had desegregated, I could use any restaurant I wanted. I could go into any drug
           store I wanted. I could ride on the bus anywhere. I was a longshoreman at 13. I used the white restroom on the Gulf Coast.
           Only Dr. Felix Dunn [phonetic], who was a black, wealthy political person and I did that. Now I did it not because it had
           anything to do with nonviolence. I did it because my father would've killed any 20 people that had anything to say to me.

INTERVIEWER: Didn't you know that there was a great difference between where you lived in Mississippi and the rest of Mississippi? How
             did you balance in your mind the fact that you were able to do these things here, but just a few miles away you would take
             your life in your hands to do them?

MR. GUYOT: What really brought this home to me was I went to Tougaloo College. Tougaloo College was threatened with extinction by the
           State Legislature. It had an interracial faculty. It was perfectly designed for me. I needed to be some place that was
           academically free, that would be committed to social change, and that would be committed to empowerment and the development
           of leadership. Tougaloo was all of that. When I get there I meet Ed King. I meet David Broder [phonetic]. I meet Ernest
           Borinski [phonetic]. Ernest Borinski is a Jew driven out of Germany. He comes to Tougaloo. He becomes an institution man. He
           develops a theory that some institutions are functional only by their absence of function. That's the Democratic Party in
           Mississippi. It only needs to be organized every four years. They go to a convention; they come back; and then it disbands.
           If they don't disband, then they have to answer people's problems. You can run the state apparatus without doing that.I meet
           A.A. Branch. A.A. Branch is a member of the leadership of the YMCA. A.A. Branch says to us the policy of Tougaloo is you can
           become involved in any demonstration you want around voting. We're going to assist you in doing that, but take your books
           with you. We're going to test you just like everyone else. Only Tougaloo College and Miles College did that. No other
           college in the South or in America did that to my knowledge.I'm in the perfect place for me. I meet people who are committed
           to nonviolence. I meet John Salter, who teaches me everything I need to know about socialism. A.A. Branch is a leader of the
           YWCA, but as A.A. Branch walks into the COFO office with the papers to join with the United Church of Christ and the
           National Council of Churches in taking over the WLBT television station. 

INTERVIEWER: Before we jump this far ahead, tell me the names of some of the students you went to school with whom we know as movement
             people.

MR. GUYOT: I went to school with Dorie Ladner.

INTERVIEWER: Joyce.

MR. GUYOT: Joyce Ladner. Quite a few people. Franklin. Johnny Frazier, who was one of the leaders. He wasn't a student there, but I
           worked in conjunction with him. Quite a few people. Anderson, who later becomes a member of the State Supreme Court.

INTERVIEWER: I know this is counterfactual, but what if you had gone to Jackson State instead of Tougaloo? How would Lawrence Guyot have
             turned out do you think?

MR. GUYOT: I don't think I would've lasted at Jackson State. I believe I come from a town that created a certain political expectation
           of what was expected of me by my family and by my church. I wouldn't have fit into the strict, rigid conformity and
           hierarchal leadership of Jackson State. Dorie Ladner and Joyce Ladner went there first. They had to leave there and come to
           Tougaloo. Tougaloo was an Oasis in the State of Mississippi. It was committed to academic freedom, committed to growth, and
           to leadership. Its very existence was threatened by the state legislature, but they continued to move ahead.

INTERVIEWER: Again, let me back up a little bit. I was just thinking about Pass Christian and the community you grew up in, the Catholic
             Church's influence, and the influence of labor unions. Most of Mississippi doesn't have this. Most of the South doesn't have
             this.

MR. GUYOT: That's right.

INTERVIEWER: It's only when you get into Louisiana that there's any real Catholic presence. Outside of your section of Mississippi,
             probably not much any place else. The same would be true of Alabama, Georgia, and so on. Do you ever consider how lucky you
             were to run into the Catholic Church and to live in a community where labor unions flourished? 

MR. GUYOT: Let me add one other thing to it and I'll respond to your question. You also had Keesler Air Force Base, which was a major
           dynamo. Yes. I consider myself very fortunate. I was born in the right town. I get to go to the right church. I get to go to
           the right college. Then I run into SNCC. I come from a family that understands.In 1964 my favorite uncle says me the mayor
           wants to meet with you about the Summer Project. I grew walk up the steps to his house. He said but I don't want you to call
           him from my house. My uncle's scared about being tied to this. But I go down and talk to the mayor. I said here's what we're
           going to do. He said here's what we're going to do. That's it. I give no quarter. They give no quarter. This is '64.Then in
           '66 that same uncle runs for Alderman in Pass Christian. You get an idea of impact of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

INTERVIEWER: A moment ago you said you ran into SNCC. Tell me about running into SNCC. How did that happen? Who embodied SNCC for you?

MR. GUYOT: Dorie Ladner, Joyce Ladner, and Bob Moses. I meet Bob Moses, John Doar, and Marion Barry all at the same time. They come out
           of McComb. We're all working at 714 Rose Street. There we have Moses, the Ladners, Bevel [phonetic], Diane, quite a few
           other folks, Lavon Brown, Sheila Michaels. This is the Freedom House, right?From there, we move into the Delta. We go to
           Amzie Moore's house. Amzie Moore parcels it out to Joe McDonald and assistants. We run across a lady named Fannie Lou Hamer.
           Bevel, me, McLaurin and Forman go to a mass meeting. We open the call for anyone who wants to go down and register. Fannie
           Lou Hamer raises her hand. We run across a woman who is a religious fundamentalist who knows the bible, a woman who has a
           perfect sense of timing in her speech pattern. She can weave together three different issues and collapse them in 25 words
           and bring it all together. She's a woman who walks into churches and who takes over. If the minister is a good minister, she
           treats him as a good minister. If he's wavering, she preaches to him before his congregation and nobody says a word to
           her.Here we get the perfect melding of religious fundamentalism and pragmatic politics. Not only does she go to register to
           vote, but as you know, she becomes a national celebrity. She becomes a woman who Andy Young takes to meet with Senator
           Church when he wants to talk about Vietnam. She's one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. She's the
           woman who speaks at the '64 Democratic Convention. Lyndon Johnson calls a press conference to interrupt her.At that time,
           there was only ABC, NBC, and CBS, and they all play her speech in its entirety that evening. Then there are 1,200 telegrams
           saying to seek the Freedom Democratic Party. Then Lyndon has to apply pressure because Lyndon says--and he says it in his
           tapes--the good thing about Lyndon is we got tapes on him. Lyndon says, "Look, we can't have a floor fight to seat an
           all-white delegation and then go and ask black people to vote for us in November, so the floor fight must be stopped." Then
           as President of the United States, he pulled out all of the stops. Delegates from California, one of them was told, "Your
           husband can be a federal judge. All you have to do is stop voting for the Freedom Democratic Party." Candidates in New York
           were told, "You all have a lot of OEO money, the Office of Economic

INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] Yeah.

MR. GUYOT: You can keep it as long as you stop supporting the freedom. They went to the delegates in California. Unfortunately, the
           California Democratic Party had passed the delegation supporting their position. But the President put all of his pressure
           on all of them. As you know, we couldn't get the floor fight. Not being able to get the floor fight, we were then offered a
           compromise of two people.I'm proud of the fact that I'm the chairman of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. I'm in
           jail in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. I couldn't have given a speech as good as Fannie Lou Hamer did. I couldn't have led the
           Freedom Democratic Party into making what I considered the most courageous, pragmatic, political decision in American
           politics. They said to this compromise, "No." It's interesting. Some historians--as you know, Bayard Rustin comes out late
           after that with an article called "The difference between politics and protest" in Commentary Magazine. What I am so proud
           of is no delegation went to the '64 Democratic Convention who understood the relationship between dying and the right to
           vote. Every one of these people had lost money, had served time in jail, had had their names posted in the newspaper when
           they registered to vote. They were willing to take on the strongest political organization in the State of Mississippi, the
           Democratic Party, and they were willing to go into Lyndon Johnson's convention and fight in it as though it was their
           convention.

INTERVIEWER: Let me back you up one more time. You're going to Tougaloo and you're majoring in biology and minoring in philosophy. Why'd
             you choose these fields? What was your career plan then?

MR. GUYOT: My career plan then was to become a doctor. Then I ran into chemistry and I changed my career plan. I just couldn't. When I
           tested while in Tougaloo, I scored off the charts on everything except mathematics and chemistry. Well, there was no way I
           was going to be a doctor having those, so I made a shift.

INTERVIEWER: What would you have been?

MR. GUYOT: If I had had my druthers, I'd have been a lawyer.

INTERVIEWER: Why didn't you go that way?

MR. GUYOT: Why didn't I go that way? Because I understood the universality both of politics and how much the judiciary had framed that.
           I understood the Brown case. I understood the Baker vs. Carr now opened up the political arena to the courts, which meant
           that there would be more power. History proves me right on that. We have reached a point in this country where we have an
           excellent power and scope of the judiciary, and now we got to fight to keep it.

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned a moment ago about running into Bob Moses and the Ladner sisters and so on, and finding this community of
             people who make up the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. What did you think of them? What was your impression of
             them and how in your mind did they differ from the run-of-the-mill college students and others you were associated with?

MR. GUYOT: I thought that these were people who had a religious commitment to interracialism; that they were fundamentally about
           change; that they were different from the other organizers that I'd been exposed to in that they were not about creating
           membership. They were about creating empowerment. That is what fascinated me. Here were people who were very well educated
           who could think on their feet, who were interdependent, and who had fierce respect for one another.Once I saw how they
           operated, then I was totally captivated. Their position was that they were going to work with established leaders who were
           there: E.W. Steptoe; later Hartman Turnbow. They go into McComb. I don't go into McComb. SNCC is almost killed, almost shot
           out of McComb. What it discovers is that the black community will protect and support them. It will hide the. It will feed
           them. It will clothe them. It will lie for them. It will do anything to protect them. This carries us into the Delta.Then we
           go into Greenwood and we find that in Greenwood, Mississippi there was tremendous fear. Moses proposed let's have some… I
           said no; they don't know us yet. We got better known moving around. Then when we had demonstrations, we had 100 people come
           into the jail to bring us food and support. That's not supposed to happen. What is the one thing black people learn? Don't
           go to jail. Don’t be associated with those who go to jail. If you're their friends, wait until they get out of jail to be
           friends. We push Greenwood to the point where we have 500 people come down to register to vote. Hardy Lott, a segregationist
           lawyer who defends Byron De La Beckwith says to me in the Leflore County Courthouse one day. "Guyot, you should be very
           proud of how many people you all got coming down in Leflore County."I said, "Well, Mr. Lott, I understand. We got them
           coming down and you're all turning them away from registration. What we need to do is create a situation where they can come
           down and get registered. He said, "Well, that's going to be a good fight." It proved to be a good fight because what we were
           able to do in Greenwood was force the Department of Justice. Once the voter registration workers got arrested there, John
           Doar says, "Okay, we're going into court," but instead of filing a type A suit, he files a type B suit, which just gets us
           out.What we found was that the Department of Justice to this day defends their position by saying we didn't want to occupy
           Leflore County. Remember, while this was going on there was also the case of Ole Miss and there was the case of Theron
           Lynd.I think one of the major achievements of SNCC was to bring about a working relationship with the Department of Justice.
           We trained them. We took John Doar to Walthall County. We introduced John Doar to a man named John Hardy. John Hardy was a
           SNCC activist who brought some people in to register to vote. Mr. Woods, the registrar, hit him with a gun and a stick, and
           the Department of Justice said, "Wait a minute. We're going to stop this prosecution. The reason we're stopping it is when
           you hit him, you hit every black man or woman who might want to come to register to vote."They developed a theory called an
           appeal, an injunction pending appeal. That's what they do. They said, "You can't prosecute this man," and they take you to
           the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That's right. 

INTERVIEWER: Couldn't we say that one of the reasons that happened is because of somebody like John Doar. Not because of the department
             itself, but because somebody like John Doar stood out among his fellows and pushed hard for these kinds of remedies.

MR. GUYOT: John Doar was not the ordinary Department of Justice. John Doar believed in going into the field, finding out where the
           danger was, and he trained his staff to do that. There's no question. John Doar participates not only in that, but John Doar
           also, when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party files the first private lawsuit under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
           John Doar and the Department of Justice filed an amicus. We go to the Supreme Court. We win it 8 to 1.What does that case
           say? That case says right now the law says that the attorney general is the only one who can institute suits, but we're
           going to take the position that from this day forward anyone who's aggrieved by Section 5 has the right to bring a lawsuit
           under Section 5. You see the range that they're giving it? They broadened Section 5. They give us the best possible
           interpretation we can. Now this case is my idea. I read a book called Gideon's Trumpet by Anthony Lewis. It describes Lyndon
           Johnson as someone who stole his election. I'd been trained well enough to know that if you had the choice between trained
           by being given guidance by a thief or by a bishop, choose the thief. The bishop will tell you no; this is not right. The
           thief will tell you this is how I did it and this is how I've stopped other people from doing it. I knew that Lyndon Johnson
           didn't want anyone to ever be able to do what he had done. I go and I find Section 5. It's the most beautiful language ever
           written. It says that any change by a covered political subdivision that has the possibility of diluting the Voting Rights
           Act must either be pre-cleared by the Department of Justice or litigated before a three-judge panel only in the District of
           Columbia. Most beautiful words I've ever heard. What we do, once we win that case before the Supreme Court, all lawyers in
           the South switch from the Fifth Amendment to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

INTERVIEWER: The work you're doing with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and these colleagues that you've mentioned earlier
             doesn't come without a cost, and you're beaten a couple of times. I don't know if it's painful for you now to talk about
             that. 

MR. GUYOT: No, it's not painful. It's factual.

INTERVIEWER: Tell us about these two cases of where you were beaten.

MR. GUYOT: One of them was in Winona. Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie Devine, Annelle Ponder, James West, and June Johnson are returning from a
           South Carolina meeting. They stop in Winona. They are arrested. I call and ask, "Do you have these people?" He said, "Well,
           come on over and find out."I go over and I know they're there. They beat me almost to death and they want me to sign a
           statement saying I drove over there and fell out of a car and hurt myself. I said I'm not going to sign that. I'd never
           driven a car in my life and I wasn't going to sign it.

MALE VOICE: Just pause for a moment just so you can get some water. Give me one second.

MR. GUYOT: I leave Greenwood and I go into Winona. I'm beaten. They threaten to burn my testicles with wooden sticks. I know that I
           have to stay conscious; otherwise, they're going to kill me. I'm beaten by 12 people and I'm asked to sign a statement which
           I refuse to sign. Then they charge me with murder.

INTERVIEWER: Who had you killed?

MR. GUYOT: I hadn't killed anyone.

INTERVIEWER: Who did they say you killed?

MR. GUYOT: I had a note from someone who had given in the street someone had been killed, and they took that and said, "Well, you
           killed him." What I found was that I knew that I wasn't going to get out of Winona alive. I didn't think any of us that were
           there. They left my cell door open. They left a knife outside. They sent someone who showed me a fake badge saying, "I'm an
           FBI agent; now tell me what really happened."Medgar Evers was killed while we were in Winona. I turned off the radio. I knew
           something tragic had happened. I just didn't know who. Then, Andy Young Bevel and Frank Smith come to get me out of jail.
           Then we eventually go to the Medgar Evers funeral, and then I leave there and go to Hattiesburg. It was clear to me that we
           were beaten too badly. We were beaten almost beyond recognition. They were not going to allow us to go about and have
           pictures taken.As unfortunate as it is, I believe that there are two things that saved our lives. One, Roberta Goller and
           other people from across the country started calling in to ask to speak to us, that let them know that other people
           know.Number two, the assassination of Medgar Evers. I'd been beaten quite a few other times, but what one time that I
           remember vividly that I wasn't beaten, but I think it's something I want to talk about now, we were driving in a car from
           Hattiesburg, Jackson, and it was a car that couldn't go over 50 miles an hour. It had bad tires. Some people with shotguns
           were behind us. I said stop the car. I got out, I walked back, and I looked in the… I said, "Look, the FBI's been
           following us. If you want to go to jail for 10 years, just do anything to anybody in that car." Those good old boys turned
           around and then we got back in the car. He asked you and I lied, but I'd rather lie and take control of my life than to
           leave it to someone else who I didn't think had my good being intentions.

INTERVIEWER: Eleanor Holmes Norton, who's the District's representative to the congress has known you since the early 1960s. In fact, did
             she come with you to get the people out of jail in Winona?

MR. GUYOT: She was involved in it.

INTERVIEWER: She was a young lawyer then.

MR. GUYOT: She was a lawyer. Yes.

INTERVIEWER: She said you walked right into terror. What did she mean by that?

MR. GUYOT: She said that at a dinner that was given in my name here in Washington. The way she laid it out was she said, "Look, all
           black southern men were told to stay out of jail." If your friends are in jail, send them money, pray for them, but don't go
           visit them." Here was man who knew that there were civil rights workers arrested and he went right into jail knowing what
           the terror was. He looked at terror and walked right into it. I felt very complimented about that.

INTERVIEWER: Can you tell us quickly what differences before between the NAACP, long-established organization active across the State of
             Mississippi, and SLCL, relatively new organization. How do these organizations differ in the ways they operated in
             Mississippi with SNCC-- NAACP, SCLC, and SNCC?

INTERVIEWER: The NAACP took the position--and I'm quoting Roy Wilkins who said part of this on the great documentary "Eyes on the
             Prize"--Mississippi is a bestial state. It should be cut off and allowed to be drifted to sea. He didn't say this on camera,
             but he said it later. Anyone who attempts to organize is crazy. Were going to raise money out of the atrocities of
             Mississippi and move forward. We're going to litigate there when possible and that's it.SCLC is a tougher problem to answer.
             Everything that was done that shows how creative, how pluralistic, how indigenous and how really sophisticated the politics
             in Mississippi was, was backed by Martin Luther King. We got to separate Martin Luther King from SCLC. Martin Luther King
             supported us in the Freedom Election, which we got 80,000 voters. He supported us in the Summer Project, which we were able
             to really create the Freedom Democratic Party, create the Freedom Schools, and create the Wednesday Group by Dorothy Height.
             The Wednesday Group was bringing in black and white women from across the country. They meet with people who were in the
             movement and then go back and talk to their ministers, their bishops, and their senators and their congressman. We also
             create the Freedom Schools, which are to this day carried out by the Children's Defense Fund.

INTERVIEWER: Why is there this dichotomy between Martin Luther King, the head of SCLC, and SCLC? Why is he behaving in one way and the
             organization is behaving in another way?

MR. GUYOT: Well, I'll tell you why. I think what he appreciated was the freedom and the creativity of what was going on in Mississippi.
           Here we were sending a message to the country that if you allow us to vote in Mississippi unimpeded, we will do it. 80,000
           people backed that up. We said about '64 Summer Project we can't bring Mississippi to America, but we can bring America to
           Mississippi. We found out we could not protect ourselves. We're going to be picked off one by one. We were organizing
           against the entire state apparatus of Mississippi and the country. The country was totally indifferent to voting. We had to
           nationalize this problem.We then challenged the Democratic Party in Atlantic City. We were supported in all of these
           endeavors by Martin Luther King. He supports us in the congressional challenge. Then I asked him to do something harder than
           anything else he'd ever done. I said, "Look, Martin. We know that the Voting Rights Act is going to pass. We need you to
           sign a memorandum along with me, John Lewis, and other people, saying that we realized the Voting Rights Act is going to
           pass, but the congressional delegation of Mississippi still should be unseated. He does it.When he does that, they said
           first of all you all forged his name. He sticks with us. Then what happens, Julian, is--and this is David Garrow in his
           book. As you know, David Garrow is the chronicle of Martin Luther, makes the point that the Freedom Democratic Party in this
           memorandum had a larger impact on the Voting Rights Act than did Selma. David Garrow says it.This all happened because of a
           guy named Michael Thelwell. Michael Thelwell gets a chance to attend the leadership conference meetings. When you read the
           first proposal for the Voting Rights Act, it's as weak as can be. You would need 20 complaints and the president may
           authorize. We needed a greater trigger mechanism. Section 5 was that trigger mechanism, but Section 5 wouldn't have been
           created unless we brought the congressional challenge. We got 149 congressmen to say yes, the congressional delegation from
           Mississippi, GBC. At the same time, the United States Supreme Court was hearing a case called the United States versus
           Mississippi filed in 1962 that argued in 1965 that it would declare all of the laws in Mississippi unconstitutional. Imagine
           if you will if the Department of Justice had asked for emergency relief. That would've meant new elections for everything in
           Mississippi. They didn't. Because of course Lyndon didn't want to fight with us in '64 and then give us the gift of
           political empowerment in '65. What I'm saying, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee leads to one of the most
           brilliant encumbering people involving empowerment process of attack on any oppressed state. There was no state more
           oppressed than Mississippi. Lyndon Johnson said it best. There's America; there's the South; and then there's Mississippi.

INTERVIEWER: I've said and I have people object to me saying that you and I and others like us belong to the last generation of African
             Americans who have engaged in sustained mobilization in the 20th century. You and I are members of the last generation that
             have done that. Nothing has happened since we were of college age. We haven't seen any repetition of this. Why is that so?
             Why are we unique?

MR. GUYOT: I'll tell you why. We're not really unique. I appreciate the laudatory way in which you handled that.

INTERVIEWER: Thanks. I like to praise us.

MR. GUYOT: I want to say very clearly we are entitled to praise. We are a group of people who changed the world.

INTERVIEWER: Of course.

MR. GUYOT: It is very important that we understand it, but when we look at operation understanding, when we look at cultural
           leadership, when we look at the Children's Defense Fund, I think the best training of what we did is now being done by those
           three groups and the young people's project headed by Moses' children. They are doing the kind of organizing we did. What we
           must do is use the mantra of pull the power right here. We got the literature. We got the mantra. We got the history. What
           we have an opportunity to do and it is very necessary for us to do it meld our experience. What distinguishes us from a lot
           of other people; we saw total oppression and we brought about change. Every impediment to us we turned it around. You can't
           register to vote? We're going to register to vote. You won't allow us to vote? We're going to vote anyway.You can't organize
           politically. We were not going to allow you to. We were going to put your name in the newspaper. When we get, Julian,
           thousands of people who have everything to risk and they are willing to risk their lives and their children's lives and
           everything they have, and you can't do it secretly, that's success. That's called real political mobilization.I think from
           January 23rd to 26th, the people who created this, the veterans of the civil rights movement in Mississippi were meeting.
           Yesterday I read in the Washington Post about civil rights activist going online. The Color Purple, the NAACP. My concern is
           how do we get those people to come down? As far as I'm concerned, the greatest organizers in America come out of Mississippi
           and SNCC. Who do you compare us to?

INTERVIEWER: No one. There is no comparison.

MR. GUYOT: None.

INTERVIEWER: There's no mobilization of the sort we engaged in in the 1960s today. I'm always asking why is this so? Why is it such a
             failure of our community to mobilize in the way we did when we were young people and a little more vigorous than we are
             now?

MR. GUYOT: Let me give you what is the most logical and most practical answer. We're now given the perfect solution, the perfect
           opportunity that brings us back to that period. If we allow the Republicans to have control of the house and the senate,
           except for the next two years--they don't control the senate--then we must forever write off that whole beautiful mantra
           that we created before then. It's very clear. I'm astounded that the political commentators look at a sense of equivalence
           between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. There is none. The Republican Party is by definition obstructionist
           and wants to narrow the scope and function of government. The Democratic Party wants to do just the converse. We now have a
           golden opportunity to fight for what we have because it's all on the table, everything you can imagine, given the
           Republican's need to destroy America as we know it. We can prevent them. A million of us who voted in 2008 didn't vote in
           the midterm elections. What we've got to do now is use all of our resources. For the next two years, I'm going to do nothing
           but push books, the mantra of SNCC, the example of SNCC as an organizing vehicle, and I'm going to call on everyone who
           participated in the Freedom Elections, in the Freedom Riots, in the Summer Project. You name them. It's time for action
           now.The reason I can do that with confidence is there's a difference between people who have made change and there's a
           difference to people who have written about change. We are those who made change. We now simply have to bring in young
           people to help us do it again.

INTERVIEWER: We seem to have trouble with attracting insufficient number of young people today. I know you mentioned the Moses children
             were doing wonderful work and the other groups were doing wonderful work, but there's no equivalent today of the actions we
             engaged in in the 1960s. No equivalent anywhere in the country that I can see.

MR. GUYOT: Let me say to you my dear friend, if there was ever a time to get into motion to bring that about, it is now. We've got two
           years.

INTERVIEWER: Absolutely. If we don't act now, it's all lost.

MR. GUYOT: Not only will it be lost, but it will be irretrievable. It's not a question of waiting 10 years and there'll be another
           flip.

INTERVIEWER: No. It won't happen. Well, let's not deal with these dim thoughts. I want you to give the people who will see this some
             picture of how you occupied yourself say in the summer of 1964. What would a typical week be for you if there's such a thing
             as a typical week in Mississippi in 1964? How would you occupy yourself? What would you do all day? 

MR. GUYOT: I would stay in contact with people who were organizing. I would--

INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] Where would you be located in the summer of '64?

MR. GUYOT: I would be in Hattiesburg, Mississippi or in Jackson or in Greenwood.

INTERVIEWER: The SNCC headquarters was in Greenwood for the summer.

MR. GUYOT: That's right. I was one of the first to go into Greenwood. My job was to stay abreast of the political… Where did
           communities need help? What kind of support did they need? How could we assist them in empowering people? Our position was
           SNCC people were capable. One or two SNCC people would go into a town, get it organized in two weeks, and find a place to
           stay, all on a salary of $10 a week when it was available.We wanted to facilitate that as much as possible. We had to stay
           in tough with the political news. What was happening on the other side? How did we respond to it? What kind of pressure
           release is there? Then we'd call you and Mary King and others when we needed help. It meant setting up meetings, carrying
           out meetings, and improving the skills of the leadership that was there.Harry Bowie and I traveled the state of Mississippi.
           Bowie was a black Episcopalian, one of the most brilliant men I've ever met. He worked for the Delta Ministry. The Delta
           Ministry was organized because I invited all religious groups to come to Hattiesburg in '63. When SNCC leaves Mississippi in
           '66, they're replaced by the Delta Ministry.The new ally for the Freedom Democratic Party is the Delta Ministry. They
           support the Children's Defense Fund. The Children's Defense Fund headed by Edelman hires 3,000 people in Mississippi. That
           instantly becomes a negative attraction to Senator Stennis, and he must be killed, so there's an attempt to destroy it. It
           is the ability of SNCC to continue to bring in forces to be used in its political methodology. We bring in the Lawyer's
           Committee for Civil Rights under the law. I'm proud of the fact that they were to the left and we got castigated for that. I
           remember when Dave Dennis, Bob Moses, and I met with Counselor Canoy [phonetic] and others. I said, "Do you all agree that
           we will make the decisions and you all do the litigating?" They said yes, and they never deviated from that. I'm very proud
           that SNCC took the position that we were not going to let anyone tell us what to do. I remember after Kennedy was killed
           there was a request by Lyndon Johnson that there be a moratorium on demonstrations. Theodore White had written a book saying
           that SNCC was really communist, really dangerous people. We analyzed that we had a conference at Howard University. Bayard
           Rustin spoke there. Baldwin spoke there. The great socialist Norman Thomas spoke there. Norman Thomas said, "Look, we can't
           win by singing, but we can't win unless we sing." He said, "You must understand. Every program that we came up with, the
           Democrats litigated, turned into laws." The question was: would we be part of the nullification? We said no. We're going to
           have a Summer Project.Summer Project was not universally01:8:49 accepted. Fannie Lou Hamer and I were two of the few people
           that supported it originally. Once Bob Moses comes back from McComb, when one of the witnesses was killed that evening, that
           witness to the Herbert Lee killing. He then throws his weight behind--

INTERVIEWER: Louis Allen.

MR. GUYOT: Louis Allen. He then throws his weight behind Summer Project, and it happens. I think the Summer Project was one of the most
           creative, indigenous, empowering, nationalizing activities. It couldn't have been pulled off by anyone but SNCC. SNCC was
           not answerable to anyone who could tell it anything. When we pulled off the Freedom Election, the Voter Education Project
           said we can no longer fund you all.

INTERVIEWER: When you were doing this activity with SNCC, how much were you paid?

MR. GUYOT: $10 a week. 

INTERVIEWER: This is before you were married?

MR. GUYOT: That's right.

INTERVIEWER: Did you get married while you worked for SNCC?

MR. GUYOT: Yes.

INTERVIEWER: Did your salary go up?

MR. GUYOT: No.

INTERVIEWER: Mine did.

MR. GUYOT: I'm glad you did.

INTERVIEWER: But I had children. You mentioned earlier on, and I'm amazed that you recall, the 714 Rose Street, which is the address of
             the Freedom House in Jackson. What would life be like with Freedom House?

MR. GUYOT: Life would be like this. Bevel was there. Diane was there. Thomas Gaither was there. Paul Brooks was there. Dorie Ladner was
           there. Joyce Ladner was there. Moses was there. I was there. Lavon Brown was there. What it served as is a reconciliation
           post for everyone arrested in the Freedom Riots. Because when you got arrested in the Freedom Riots, you were tried in
           Jackson. When you came to Jackson, you came to 714 Rose Street.Then we acquainted you with what was going on in the state
           and how you could be helpful when you went back to wherever you were. It was this cross-fertilization of activism that was
           uninhibited, that was indigenous, that was empowering, and that was answerable to no one. We were able to creatively involve
           all the major…The National Council of Churches gets committed once they come to Hattiesburg. They create the Delta
           Ministry, which lasts for 25 years. They also join us when we challenge the congressional delegation. Breeden, Fitzsimmons,
           these are people from the National Council of Churches. They come to us and they talk to Michael Thelwell. I said, "What can
           we do about the congressional challenge?" They said, "What you can do is open doors. Where we don’t have a civil rights
           movement, we have churches." James Farmer of CORE and I got to talk to Forwood [phonetic], who later becomes President
           Forwood because his bishop called him and said you got to talk to him.What we found is that the labor unions remember. At
           the Howard University meeting, the FLCL [phonetic] said to us, "We're going to give you a contribution of $25,000, and we're
           going to send for Board of Directors to tell you what to do." You can imagine how long that lasted.Then if you look at when
           the Summer Project was agreed to, some people said to us, "William Sloane Coffin has to head this." It never happened,
           Julian. Then you remember the great meeting in New York after the Democratic convention. You got Gloster Current; you got
           Roy Wilkins; you got Courtland Cox; you got James Farmer. They said, "Look, Mississippi is now becoming a national and
           international paradigm. We can't allow the people that are running it down there to run it, the underbrushing"

INTERVIEWER: Ignorant people like Fannie Lou Hamer.

MR. GUYOT: Like Fannie Lou Hamer, and the underbrush like--

INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] Incredible.

MR. GUYOT: Courtland said, "Don't you think you should talk to the people in Mississippi about this?" They said no. What we found was
           that we were creating something in Mississippi. When you beat the best, and when you can organize around the worst, then you
           create a political example of what can be.Curtis Gaines, who is one of the top demographers of the vote ever year wrote a
           letter in 1965. He said, "I've toured the South and if this SNCC MFDP kind of operation is allowed to happen in the South,
           it will not be loyal to the National Democratic Party. This letter is written in its entire in Local People by John Dittmer.
           I got it, I gave it to Dittmer, and he put it in the book. He said what we must do is 01:3:58 quickly pass the Voting Rights
           Act so we can then bring blacks into the Democratic Party. I just wanted to say that to say, "Look at how many other forces
           we were resonating with, and they put their own interpretation on it."The NEA and AFT both send representatives to the
           Summer Project to capture the Freedom curriculum. We meet in Hartford, Connecticut years later. There's someone there who
           stands up and says we had a discussion about the curriculum for the Freedom Schools last week. There's this tremendous
           infusion of bringing the political process to the average citizen.

INTERVIEWER: After '64, did you leave Mississippi? When did you move to D.C.?

MR. GUYOT: I moved to D.C. in 1968. I was a delegate to the Democratic convention in '68. Harry Bowie and I organized. What happened
           was this. The loyalists thought that they would become part of the regular Democratic Party. Bidwell Adams, my dear friend,
           was chairing the state convention. He said, "Look, if you don't desegregate this delegation, you're wasting your bus fare to
           Chicago." We waited for that to happen. Aaron Henry and the loyalists, who were set up as an alternative to destroy MFDP,
           they were unsuccessful.Then I said to them, "Let's join together." The loyalists hooked up with the MFDP. We got 50% of the
           delegation; they got 50%; and we were seated in '68. Harry Bowie and I met with Charles Evers and Harding Carter. They
           looked at the names. They said, "How did you all do it?" I said, "Well, look; you all had the money. You all had the
           prestige. We knew all of these people years before they knew you." We went up and selected, nominated, and we got Ms. Rutger
           [phonetic]. We got our people.

INTERVIEWER: When you came up here, you began to focus on D.C. issues. Tell us a little bit about that.

MR. GUYOT: I had a good time up here. I began to fight for the same-sex marriage. I began to fight for having the first presidential
           primary in Washington so we could point out to the country the fact that we don’t have congressional or senatorial
           representation. We get the first primary, but quite a few of the Democrats don't participate in it. Then I publicly lambast
           them for that.I fight to do away with term limits. I believe that we fought too much. Too many of us have died to allow the
           calendar to determine the political situation. We do away with term limits here. I find this a very creative city council.
           It is one that I can operate conveniently with. I become an ANC commissioner. I begin delving in economic development. I'm
           involved in everything that was developed in Columbia Heights. Every one of those 37 proposals was brought to us. We were
           told to pick a developer to analyze and to grade them. We did that.I built some of the political infrastructure of the city,
           and I am very much of an activist. I supported Fenty for mayor. I supported the write-in. I remember in 1968 and you
           remember I'm sure when we made a decision to move from the civil rights movement to carry the church with us into the
           political arena. We said we're not going to hate people, and we're going to choose the ballot instead. The bible and the
           ballot infusion.Then I see a campaign that to me was the real implementation of more hate than I've ever seen in my life.
           Fenty was not only defeated; he was turned into a hate caricature. Because of that, I joined him in the write-in. Of all the
           things I've done politically, I'm just as proud of that. One of the things I understand there very clearly, if black people
           ever make the mistake of separating our politics from our religion, we're damn not finished.

INTERVIEWER: The same time you mentioned same-sex marriage, same-sex marriage is just an anathema in many black homes and in the black
             church community. One of the biggest opponents is Walter Fauntroy, who's Dr. King's lieutenant here. How do you manage in
             your practice of Christianity to balance the support for something that many black Christians just think is terrible?

MR. GUYOT: Well, I think one of the best movements in that position is my wife. My wife and I met when I went to California. She was
           raising money for SNCC. She comes to Mississippi. We leave there. We get married in Washington in '67. She supports me in
           everything I've done. She gets the job to help pay my way through Rutgers law school. She goes to jail with me in
           Mississippi. We live together in Mississippi. My wife is white. Whenever I've gone to the hospital, she's come with me.
           Quite a few times she saved my life.I said to myself, "Can I really accept all of this and deny it to two other people of
           the same sex who are in love with one another?" I couldn't. I may shock and amaze you when I say this, but all of my
           politics has been based on my religious beliefs. I tell people. I say when you're told religiously to feed the hungry clothe
           the naked, those who are bound, it doesn’t tell you to find out what the charges are. Whenever you attempt to do any of
           those three, you enter into the political arena. That's all right because there's no other way to do it.I teach political
           empowerment. The first question I ask of my class is let's talk about something that's not political. Once we've gotten
           through that, then we go on to the question. What are you doing to enhance your political mobility and motility in options?I
           was thinking as you were talking there about the years we've known each other. I frankly have not thought about you as a
           religious person.

MR. GUYOT: I understand.

INTERVIEWER: Probably I don't know that side of you at all well.

MR. GUYOT: That's understandable. I'm not offended by that at all. I'm very happy with my relationship. I remember when you would share
           your poems early in SNCC. We both love books and we both are very proud of what we've done.I learned that we must be able to
           ethically transcend ourselves and put ourselves in other fellows' shoes, and then make a judgment. I have no problems. I
           testified before the city council and I said, "I'm astounded by people wanting to vote on denying other people human
           rights." I said, "We didn't sacrifice lives for that." The vote should be used to build, to strengthen. It should be used
           affirmatively. Quite a few people agreed with me on that. I think the beauty of politics, even though it has a bad name
           right now, will be revived. In order to save this country, we're going to have to revive it. I look at it as a good joining.
           As long as you have a country in which 6 out of 10 people don't know the difference between the various layers of
           government, how can you really create public opinion about affirmative and moving?Jefferson said it very clear. He said in
           order to have a Republican style of government, you've got to have an informed election. My dear friend, we have a most
           tragically and misinformed electorate right now.

MALE VOICE: Hold on from here because we're at the one-hour mark. I have to put in a new tape. Do you want to get up?

INTERVIEWER: No. I want to stretch.

INTERVIEWER: Ready to go?

MALE VOICE: Rolling.

INTERVIEWER: Larry, I want to go through a long list of names and ask you if you could very quickly tell the people who will see this who
             these people were.

MR. GUYOT: Very good.'

INTERVIEWER: Because we went over them very quickly earlier. John Salter.01:0:18

MR. GUYOT: John Salter was a teacher at Tougaloo College who was very political. He was involved in demonstrations in Jackson that were
           NAACP led. He worked very closely with Edgar Evers and he worked very closely with Ed King.

INTERVIEWER: Medgar Evers. 

MR. GUYOT: Medgar Evers was the executive director of the NAACP. He was a person who went disguised to get information about the Emmett
           Till case. He was the political leader of the NAACP in Mississippi. He was very involved in a lot of the political activity
           and civil rights involvement in the state.

INTERVIEWER: Tom Gaither.

MR. GUYOT: Tom Gaither was a CORE member early in Mississippi, and continues to be involved in the civil rights movement to this day.

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned when you were talking about the Freedom House earlier that it was a place of reconciliation. What did you mean
             by that?

MR. GUYOT: What I meant was that it was a place for people who regardless of where you stood in the movement, you were welcome there.
           Breeden comes into the meeting. As you know, Breeden was a leftist.

INTERVIEWER: Carl Breeden.

MR. GUYOT: Carl Breeden. He buys food. At that particular time, we didn't have any money. It was his kind of place. That's why I termed
           it that way.

INTERVIEWER: John Doar. We mentioned him a bit. Tell us a little bit more about John Doar.

MR. GUYOT: John Doar is a hero of the civil rights movement. He is best characterized as a man who was a relentless worker who didn't
           stick to the script, who was responsible for moving the Department of Justice into civil rights vigorously.

INTERVIEWER: He's an assistant attorney general. 

MR. GUYOT: He was the assistant attorney general to Robert Kennedy, who was the U.S. Attorney General. John Doar was a Republican, very
           perceptive, very creative. I watched John Doar represent the government in the case of Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman. He
           quoted [background noise]. He said people will little note here what we say, but they will long note what we do. Of course,
           those people were convicted.'John Doar, and I'm going to quote him, in 1967 was at a conference at Ole Miss and he was
           talking about the press and the civil rights movement. He said the Voting Rights Act was passed in two cities, McComb, and
           the streets of Greenwood. What we were able to do was convince John Doar and others that illiterates had the right to vote.
           We convinced them. We got that written into the Voting Rights Act. Katzenbach, who was then testifying before judiciary
           committee said, "I'm convinced of the constitutionality of all of this except the right of illiterates to vote. We got the
           congress to go along with us. No other group fought for the right of illiterates to vote except SNCC.

INTERVIEWER: Gerald Ford.

MR. GUYOT: Gerald Ford was a congressman from Michigan, and then later President of the United States. When I talked to him, he was a
           member of the congress. He agreed to talk with us. He told us because his bishop had asked him to. When we talked to him, we
           talked about the congressional challenge, what was the basis of it, and he told us that he was going to do what the law
           requires.

INTERVIEWER: The Wednesday Group. You mentioned a little bit about them. Tell us a little bit about what the Wednesday Group was.

MR. GUYOT: Of course. The Wednesday Group was organized by Dorothy Height. The Wednesday Group were people brought in from across the
           country, from various states at various times to come in and listen to the activists in Mississippi, find out what's going
           on, find out what they can do. Then they would leave and go back to their hometowns and talk to their senators, their
           congressman, their bankers, their civic clubs to put pressure on the Department of Justice to protect the Voting Rights
           activists. 

INTERVIEWER: You also mentioned a couple of times the Ladner sisters. Flesh them out a little bit more.

MR. GUYOT: Joyce and Dorie Ladner come out of Hattiesburg, Mississippi. They are related to Vernon Dahmer, who is a real civil rights
           hero. They're related to Medgar Evers. They're related to Victoria Gray, who is the National Committee woman of the Freedom
           Democratic Party, who was also very active in SCLC. Victoria Gray goes to SCLC and gives a great speech in Abernathy. Okay,
           Victor, what do you want? He said I want $7,000 for the Freedom Democratic Party and the right check.Victoria Gray was
           another religious fanatic. We had one in Fannie Lou Hamer and had another in Victoria Gray, who becomes a political
           activist, who brings in her family. There were more people in the Freedom Schools in Hattiesburg than anywhere else in the
           state. The case of Theron Lynd is tried by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Hattiesburg.

INTERVIEWER: He's the registrar in Forest County.

MR. GUYOT: He's the registrar in Forest County. He takes the position that he's not--Julian, he turned down postgraduate degree people
           because they said, "You just didn't complete the test right."There's a great book written about him. It's called "Count them
           One by One." It's written by one of the attorneys who operated in that state. Why is it a great book? Because it talks about
           the trying of Theron Lynd for contempt. It talks about the courage of the witnesses who participate in that. It establishes
           a basis, as does the office and I totally agree, for really passing the Voting Rights Act. It was very clear they were
           recalcitrants of this registrar, which was also analogous to 82 other registrars like him because there's one in each
           county. Once the court ruled against him, he simply refused to register people. This is the federal court.John Doar when
           they're trying Theron Lynd introduces me to Judge Brown, Tuttle, and Bell. There's a great book about this called "Unsung
           Heroes" by Jack Bass. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals follows and joins the Department of Justice in making sure that
           whatever they can do to back up the movement in Mississippi, they do it. We knew if we lost in Meredian or Jackson, all we
           had to do was wait until we get to New Orleans because in New Orleans we win.

INTERVIEWER: Griffin Bell voted--

MALE VOICE: One moment. We have somebody at the door. They went away?[Break in video]

INTERVIEWER: --and now hopefully was back in those days.

MR. GUYOT: The Fifth Circuit was made up of the most creative group of people who were committed to making the law useful for social
           and political change. Ironically, these were all Eisenhower appointees. Each one of them files challenge delegations in
           their states, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas. They won those positions, which helped Eisenhower get the presidency.Eisenhower
           said to them, "What do you all want?" They wanted to get on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. They established a legend of
           expanding the constitutional rights of everyone that came before them. Their position on the City of Jackson was that
           Jackson had an apartheid policy that was incomparable of anywhere else in the United States. That was the official position
           of the 5th Circuit.They validated the removal of cases filed by Arthur Canoy, and they were later overturned by the Supreme
           Court and narrowed. They validated all Section 5 cases. John Doar simply had to get to New Orleans, bring the case, and it
           was won. They overturned decision after decision by Judge Cox, who was an atrocious racist, who talked about black people
           registering to vote as a bunch of chimpanzees. Once we got to the Fifth Circuit, he was overturned.

INTERVIEWER: One of them you mentioned, however, Griffin Bell, voted against me and kept me out of the Georgia legislature for almost six
             months. 

MR. GUYOT: Griffin Bell did some things worse than that. Griffin Bell said to Andy Young, "Don't testify against Bork [phonetic]." Of
           course, as you know, Andy Young to his credit testified against Bork.I want to make it clear that of the judges on the Fifth
           Circuit, Bell was the least praiseworthy. But the Fifth Circuit was of the highest caliber of productivity for empowerment
           and for the revitalization of the 15th amendment. It as amazing. These people treated what we were doing as their work.The
           only reason the Fifth Circuit didn't send Theron Lynd to jail was because they were again concerned about the political
           impact. He was 7'4" and he weighed 400 pounds. They didn't want him to die in jail. But they tried him for contempt and they
           got what they wanted out of him.Again, once it became clear that you were faced with Theron Lynd-type recalcitrance
           throughout the State of Mississippi, then you had to come up with a new mechanism. Allah; comes the Voting Rights Act, and
           it was written by the Department of Justice.

INTERVIEWER: Let me mention another name you mentioned that needs some explanation of who he is. Michael Thelwell.

MR. GUYOT: Michael Thelwell is a brilliant man who comes out of NAG at the student--

INTERVIEWER: NAG was a Nonviolent Action Group.

MR. GUYOT: Out of Howard University. He becomes involved with SNCC. I ask him. We raised some money and I said, "Michael, here's the
           check. Go to Washington and set up an office for the NFDP. Well, what he does, he comes to Washington. He works with a
           couple of people. He is able to follow the legislation in the congress. He's able to deal with the Leadership Conference on
           Civil Rights and he's able to keep us informed on what he's doing. He writes a letter to Lyndon Johnson saying, "We're
           astounded. All of the work that the Freedom Democratic Party did to get you elected in Mississippi and none of our people
           have been invited to the inaugural." Fannie Lou Hamer calls and she says, "Mike, you know the man who's the postman?" He
           said no. She said, "Well, he brings me this big envelope from the White House."Then Mr. Turnbow calls. He said, "Michael, I
           want to let you know I got an invitation to the White House and I want you to do something for me, Michael." Michael said,
           "What do you want me to do, Mr. Turnbow?" He said, "I want you to find out what ball the Governor of Mississippi is going to
           because I want to dance with his wife."Hartman Turnbow, as you know, is a man who was accused of destroying his house,
           setting his house on fire. His wife and his daughter are in this house. He comes out shooting, and he kills a white man. The
           State of Mississippi said we can't have a situation. We're charging someone who's defending his wife and his daughter from a
           burning house as he is. What they decided, Julian, was that this man died of a heart attack.I know that you may find this
           hard to believe. John Doar and others asked me if I'd be willing to go to the sheriff or Leflore County, get him to sign
           arrested - - bond to take to the sheriff of Holmes County and have Mr. Turnbow released to me.In Holmes County, 80% of the
           black people own their land. What was so strange about this was the Department of Justice understood that the only way to
           handle this was to go along with the State of Mississippi in the position that there was no murder. It was a just a house
           burning. Of course, because the Department of Justice rigorously defends Mr. Turnbow, all charges are dropped on that. I did
           this myself.I'll tell you what. There is no other recorded event where two sheriffs in the South combine to release by bond
           that they signed civil rights workers anywhere in the South. It never happened again.

INTERVIEWER: One final name you mentioned a couple of times. Robert Moses.

MR. GUYOT: Robert Moses is a young man who came to Mississippi, a mathematician and a philosopher who was able to get the most out of
           people regardless of what they thought of themselves. Robert Moses was a person who was totally committed to social change,
           who was able to work with anyone. He was able to be both an intellectual and a total humanist. He was a man who believed
           that there was political potential in everyone and who behaved that way, and who got a lot of people associated with him to
           behave that way. He was a totally courageous person, totally committed, and a thinker that has few people on his level. He
           was able to take problems and turn them into solutions. He was able to meld the difference between the rigidity of some of
           the SNCC folks with the free expression of total liberty to others.He firmly believed that he was ahead of the game on one
           other tenant. He firmly believed that those who do the work should make the decisions. He firmly believed that whenever
           anyone was arrested in SNCC, you either go to get them out of jail or you go to jail with them.He was a man who was beaten
           in McComb, and he files charges against the person who beat him. The sheriff heard and he held a trial. We know how the
           trial went Julian. Then they guide him out of town. It's just unheard of. You mean expect to be treated legally by a legal
           system that is designed not to treat people like you? He goes before a judge in McComb and the judge brags about how good we
           treat our donkeys. Moses writes, "Racists are never more exposed than when they brag."He was a man who was able to lay out
           the framework of what's was going to happen in Mississippi. We couldn't do anything in Mississippi without the approval of
           the people of Mississippi, and we got it. We got it because we made it clear to them that we were never going to say to
           them, "Look, you need to go register to vote. Here's where the courthouse is. Go on down there." We said to them, "We're
           going and want you to come with us."We never said to them, "We're going to protect you." We never said, "Your name's going
           to be in the newspaper." We never said to them, "You'll become an enemy of the state once you register to vote." The
           complexity and the beauty of how Mississippi was organized was we got thousands of people to make that commitment. I think
           it pivoted on two things. One, our style of operation. Two, the church. Three, the need for people to create a better way of
           life for their children. We didn't have to tell people in Mississippi everything is political because they understood that
           the Board of Supervisors determined whether or not there was a hospital, whether or not there were jobs, who was going to
           get paid. You could look at who was registered to vote on the street by the houses that were paid. You wanted tax
           exemptions.There was nothing that was nonpolitical in Mississippi, so we arrived at the early conclusion that the political
           avenue was a solution to a lot of our problems. In the '60s, there was no Republican Party in the South. Nowhere to be
           found. It wasn't until 1964 that the Democratic Party in Mississippi creates the unpledged electoral system, which allows us
           to become the presidential electives for Lyndon Johnson. But it also allows the infusion of the Republican Party.In 1964,
           the Republican Party in San Francisco kicks out black delegates. Kicks them out. The Democratic Party is supporting the
           passage of the '64 public accommodations act and of course later on the '65 voting rights act. In 1960 you have the
           Democratic Party being approached to intervene in Martin Luther King's arrest. Louis Martin and others get the president to
           call Dr. King's wife, Coretta Scott King.The first black baseball player, Jackie Robinson, goes to Nixon and says, "Look,
           you can do this. You should do this." He leaves crying because Nixon refuses to do it. We both know that that telephone call
           and the blue leaflet that was passed out to every black church in America within six days is what made President Kennedy
           President Kennedy. Without the black vote--

INTERVIEWER: [Interposing] I wish I could lay my hands on a copy of that leaflet. They call it the blue bomb.

MR. GUYOT: I'm sure we can get it for you. The guy who can get it for you is a guy named Harp Davis [phonetic] at the University of
           Southern Florida. I have a copy of the trial transcript at Winona. I have a copy of every deposition taken by the
           Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and I got it all from him.

INTERVIEWER: When all is said and done, what would you like the world to know about you and the work you did in the freedom movement.

MR. GUYOT: What I'd like the world to know is that I was man who carried out his religious beliefs by his political activity. I never
           stepped away from a fight. I never asked any quarter. I never gave any. I recognize the value of reading and of books. I
           want to be remembered as someone who is committed to perpetuation of the mantra of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
           Committee.The only thing that the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee can be compared with is the Anti-Saloon League.
           The Anti-Saloon League was very effective, though short lived. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee changed the
           very concept of democracy, changed the concept of citizenship, and opened to everyone the vehicle of empowerment.
           Empowerment is something that's contagious. Once an individual makes something happen that they made happen, they're a
           different person. They don't wait for the next day. They say, "What do I need to do today?" Those are the kinds of people we
           need to have a good America.

INTERVIEWER: Is there something we should've asked you that I didn't ask?

MR. GUYOT: I can't think of anything, except that we have an obligation to transfer our skills and our knowledge to other people.
           You're doing that and I'm doing that.

INTERVIEWER: Are we doing it as much as we should.

MR. GUYOT: No, but let us hope that we will understand the gravity of our situation, and in the next two years we will spread by
           geometric progression those who are actively organizing. We don’t need people to support us and agree with us and not
           register their families to vote, not register their churches to vote, not register their clubs to vote, and not really make
           organizing a social necessity. We should declare those who are not organized and following empowerment and from the
           political change in the next two years as social pariahs. They no longer function on our behalf. Isn't it amazing how we as
           a race have moved from the concept of "us" to "me"? We're the last group that can afford that. Now we're faced with an
           opposition that is so menacing to everything we value, that now we must fight or everything we've fought for will be beyond
           retrieving.

INTERVIEWER: On that happy note, let's thank you for doing this. We greatly appreciate it.

MR. GUYOT: I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.

INTERVIEWER: It's our pleasure.

MALE VOICE: Thank you both.

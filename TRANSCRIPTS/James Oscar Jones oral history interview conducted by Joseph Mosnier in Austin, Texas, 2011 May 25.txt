JB: Wait a second; something’s wrong. Oh, no, it’s fine. Okay. We’re okay. 

JM: Okay. Today is Wednesday, May [25], 2011. [Clears throat] My name is Joe Mosnier of the - [clears throat] excuse me -
    Southern Oral History Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Uh, I am in Austin, Texas, with our
    videographer for the project, Mr. John Bishop. Uh, and we are here to interview Mr. James Oscar Jones for the, uh, joint
    project, uh, being conducted by the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian, and more particularly, the Smithsonian’s
    National Museum of African American History - African American History and Culture, excuse me, the new, uh, Civil Rights
    History Project, a national, uh, civil rights oral history series.Mr. Jones, it’s good to be with you. Thanks so much for
    sitting down with us.James Jones: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

JM: Um, as I mentioned before we turned on the camera today, I thought we’d start with, um, just a sketch of your family
    history, because I know it will have a lot to do with the course of your life. And, so I’d like to hear about where you
    were born, where you came up, your parents?

JJ: Glad to. My parents - Ernest Jones and mom, Perdis Jones. Dad, my father, born and raised on the farm - that was his life;
    that’s what he loved to do. I’m a member of a family of ten children, six boys and four girls. And the first five
    children was born as Rowden, because their dad was Rowden, and he was killed cutting logs into wood. And so, that first five
    were very young when he died, and then, my dad, Ernest Jones, married my mama and has five more children. But my dad raised
    all ten of us, because they was very, very young when their dad got killed. And, basically, what he did was - they were very
    disciplined, uh, had a seventh grade education, Mom had a seventh grade education, but very bright, very, uh, brilliant
    people.And one of the ambitions they had, that they gave us as we were little kids - he had two goals for us. He wanted all
    of us to be educated and he wanted to see all ten of us in heaven. And so, he wanted us to be committed to church, hard
    work, and school. So, I had the pleasure of going to school all the way through elementary, all the way through high school,
    and I never missed a day. He was mean and tough on us going to school.We had to get up four o’clock in the morning, milk
    the cows, feed the pigs, and do all of this, walk one mile from the house to the dirt road where the bus came by, and catch
    the bus at six forty-five. And you had to do that or you were sure that was your - and it applied to everybody, the girls
    and the boys the same way. So, we had the fortune of understanding work very early and going to school very early. And
    that’s kind of what Dad shaped. He said he was - when he bought his first acre of land, he was thirteen years old. He paid
    one dollar and twenty-five cents. It took him six months to make that dollar and twenty-five cents. So, the farm we grew up
    on were part of Frank McKinney, which is, um, Jimmy [Ed] McKinney, which is my mama’s side, but then he added to the
    acreage and grew us a good, good farm where we farmed cotton, corn. And then we had - because he couldn’t borrow any money
    from Farmers Home Administration in those days, he created, um, a large piece of the farm, and we had peach orchards and
    berries and all of that. And the cash money we made from the sale of the fruit and vegetables is what money he used to farm
    the, uh, cotton and corn with.

JM: How big was, um - and what was the nature of Willisville in those days? 

JJ: Well, when I was a little boy, it was a lot of folks there. Uh, it, uh - it never has been an incorporated town. It’s just
    a village. I would say when I grew up, two or three hundred kids, maybe. And what happened is, most of the kids grew up with
    me, migrated and took off, went to Detroit, Dallas, Texas, Houston, Texas, all those places, looking for work. We were the
    only farm, black farm group, in Willisville with a farm. All the other kids worked on farms, but they were not theirs -
    primarily white farmers’ and - and that was hard, because they weren’t allowed to go to school. They came to school
    maybe after Thanksgiving, but by March it was time to start tilling the soil again and they had to come back to work. So, a
    lot of them didn’t have that opportunity I had to go to school from grade one through high school.

JM: Yeah. How did your - how did your father manage the farm [clears throat] without all that extra help that would have been
    there if he hadn’t sent you every day to school?

JJ: Well, what, um - what he did was, all of us was big enough to do some farming, the older sisters and brothers, but also he
    always used - there was some older kids who dropped out of school and just kind of wandered. And he would go get those kids
    and bring them back, and they would work there with us. And he would pay them at the end of the day or at the end of the
    week. They was excited about that, because when they worked on the other farms that they didn’t own, a lot of time they
    were put on the books. And the problem with that system was, they never made enough money, they never worked hard enough to
    pay off those debts. So, you were always - and then, Dad would have them to come over in September when the state fair was
    taking place. And he would say, “Come on over here late in the evening, and I’ll give you a little work, so you’ll
    have a few bucks to go to the fair.” You know, and everybody wanted to go to the fair, but they didn’t have any money,
    so that’s how Dad helped out. And then, they was gracious to come over and work at our place, as well.

JM: Were your parents, um - tell me about church, and were they - were they active in the NAACP? 

JJ: My mama was very active. Dad stayed very close to the farm, you know, day in and day out. But, uh, Sunday was a day you
    couldn’t touch the farm. I mean, that was a day you had no choice but to get up and down the dirt road and fighting the
    dust, going to church - all daylong church. [Laughing] Not one service like the city folk got at eight o’clock or twelve
    o’clock. No. You went to church in the morning and when you got out of that church, you went to another church, because my
    mom had a beautiful singing voice, and everybody in the little neighborhood wanted her to come sing. We’d hop in the back
    of the truck and go to that, and if somebody had a five o’clock meeting, we’d go to that church. So, it was church,
    church, church, church! [Laughing] So, oh, yeah, I had plenty of church.

JM: Yeah. Tell me about their, you know, their sense of politics and race relations.

JJ: My mama - everybody called my mother “Vic.” Matter of fact, when she passed away, and they had the name Perdis Jones,
    and a lot of folks called the funeral home in Magnolia, said, “Who is this Perdis Jones?” So, the undertaker said,
    “Well, everybody know her as ‘Vic.’” And when he said that —. People from all over the country had left and went
    to Milwaukee. Said, “Uh-uh, y’all cannot have that funeral. Postpone that funeral because we want to come home to the
    funeral.” And that’s when the word got out it was Vic, so hundreds and hundreds of people came in.But Mama on - she was
    very active in organizations, NAACP in Magnolia - that was the closest place. She would go to those meetings, and when she
    would come back she would talk to kids at church, “Now, we got to do some things. They talked about in that meeting how we
    can do better, how we - how folk need to learn how to fix up their own homes and all that and stop depending on outside
    people.”And then, she would - when they would have those meetings, she and her sister would throw people in the back of
    the old pickup truck and they were gone. And it was not a thing where she would go ask parents’ permission. She would just
    get in that old truck and just go through, “Get in! Get in this truck! Get in this truck!” [Laughs] And they would go to
    the meetings. So, the kids, you know, growing up in a rural area, they were glad to jump in the back of the truck and go
    somewhere, you know.So, she was - that was her. She was just very active, all over the place. And, um - and when she learned
    about what people were doing, she would come back to church and talk to church people about, “What we need to do is we
    need to get the men together to do this, and then the women get together,” because that’s the kind of thing she would
    learn from the NAACP meetings. 

JM: Interesting, yeah. Do you remember, um, [clears throat] say, let’s think of a few things from the ’50s, you know, from
    Brown v. Board to Montgomery to Little Rock, especially Little Rock, given where we are, where you were? Um, were those
    things talked a lot about in the house, at church? How’d they ripple through your life is what I’m after.

JJ: The one thing I remember was in the Brown, uh, the Brown case. Thurgood Marshall - and my dad always - he had this big old
    radio, huge radio, and it was very powerful. Matter of fact, in Willisville, Arkansas, we could pick up St. Louis, and
    that’s how we kept up with baseball, always had the radio on. And Mr. Thurgood made a statement, and it was on the radio,
    he wanted every Negro in America to stand still that one day at noon, because the -

JB: Excuse me, we’ve got a problem here.

JM: I’m sorry.[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: Okay, we’re back.

JM: Um, Mr. Jones - uh, we just had a brief pause to check the camera. Um, you had just started to talk about Brown and you were
    saying an important thing about your dad in relation to Thurgood Marshall.

JJ: They was so, um, amazed by that. And Mr. Thurgood put out on radio that on that day, twelve noon, all Negroes should stand
    still at twelve noon, because, uh, uh, the Supreme Court is fixing to make an announcement, and that announcement and that
    Supreme Court are going to change this whole nation. So, Daddy, you know, said - and he went to the little school, Sweet
    Home School, where I was going to school. He went down there and told the teachers about it and said that we need to make
    sure everybody hears what, uh, is about to be said. So, he had that much politics in his head. And people got those radios
    and really was listening for that - for that announcement.So, he - he stayed on top of stuff the same way - he was that same
    way about farming. He could not borrow money from Farmers Home Administration. But what he would do is that he kept his eyes
    very close on what white farmers were doing. And some of the wealthier white farmers would, um, use these plows, and they
    would break a plow, and they had the ability to go to get money and get a new one.And what he did was he would ask those
    black guys that were working for those white owners, he said, “What they going to do with that plow?”“Oh, nothing.
    We’ve already gone and got another.” He said, um, “I want to see if I can get that plow.”So, they would say, “Mr.
    Warmack, um, Ernest want that plow.”“He can have it. It’s broke.”And he would take it up to - because the little
    school we went to had a vocational school. And the kids would experiment with, um, welding that back. And so, we would use
    those plows, so that was - those were an accumulation that he didn’t have to pay for as part of his farming. So, he was on
    top of the farming, as well as, um, um, the political side of things.

JM: Yeah, yeah. Um, the fact that your father owned his own farm - how much did that matter, in two ways: one, in relation to
    other members of the black community locally -

JJ: Um-hmm.

JM: And in relation to, um, maybe how your life unfolded in, uh, in a sense of how you measured your own possibilities and
    independence.

JJ: Um-hmm. The first part, on the, um, the farm side, when Mom and Dad - people who lived on other farms, and they had very
    poor houses. He knew that if we did any kind of work on those houses, they would get tossed off the farm. What he would do,
    he would have us to go and help them - they had cracks in the house and all that kind of stuff. We would go cut wood and put
    it on the inside to seal the - to seal the holes and everything, and that was no cost. And that was something we, his sons,
    we had to do it.And when, and if we - I remember the one time my brother under me, he took a quarter from this little lady.
    She says, “Y’all do so much, and we’re just so thankful. Here, y’all take this quarter.” I told Chester, “Uh-uh,
    don’t take no money. You know Dad. This is something he want us to do for folks.”And we went home, and Daddy would say,
    “Did you boys take any money?”I said, “No, sir.” I said, “Chester did.”He said, “Well, how much money did, uh
    -?” I don’t remember her name.I said, “Gave him a quarter.”“Give me that quarter.” And so, he took the quarter,
    and we went to church Sunday. [Laughs] He made Chester take that quarter up to the pulpit and put it in the offering. He
    could not spend it. [Laughs] So, and we did that for a lot of elderly people. And so, he was just that kind of caring.On the
    other side, I was being kind of trained to do something pretty good, but I didn’t see it, because Dad and Mama would go to
    the school and would have all these talks with the teachers. And what they was talking about, later on I learned from my
    older sisters and brothers, is that they said, “James, Dad and Mom is very proud of you. You’re real smart, and
    they’re telling those teachers to push you, push you real hard because you’ve got the smarts.”But I learned that a
    little later because I noticed I always have to do everything at school - everything! We have a little school program: “We
    want you to be the emcee.” “We want you to, uh, start that group.” “We want you to be over the agriculture
    program,” and I had all these assignments. And so, when I would come home, um, I didn’t get a chance to go out and play
    because I had to do all these things. And they were talking about, “Now, James, you’ve got to get all of that stuff
    done.” So, between feeding the hogs and the chickens and all that, and doing that, by that time, it was dark. And I also
    played basketball on the basketball team, but I didn’t see anything in that.But when I got a little further in, um,
    school, toward the eleventh grade, I could see it. Uh, “We want you to do some marvelous things, James.” And,
    “You’ve got the skills. You’re smart. You do good work in school. You’re going places.” That’s when they
    started, uh, encouraging me. And then, when that happened, uh, I was playing basketball, and this was a real shock to me,
    because, you know, we worked hard, but Daddy didn’t give you no money.And we would always ask Daddy, “Daddy, why do you
    - other kids come work on the farm - why do you pay them, but you don’t pay us?” He said, “That’s because I’m
    saving for hard times.” [Laughs] So, my sister Clara [Lee] said, “Well, Dad, it’s pretty hard.” [Laughs] He said,
    “No. You don’t even know what hard time is. You’ve got to a place to stay. You’ve got clothes.” He was teaching
    us, “You don’t know what a hard time is.”And then, the guys way across what we called the creek, the bus didn’t go
    over there, so they would - basketball guys - they would come over to our house and stay with us, and the bus would come
    down this dirt road. And we were playing in this district, uh, tournament, and Daddy came up to us and he had like
    twenty-five dollars in change and one-dollar bills. He said, “James, take this, and, uh, you boys got a little money to
    spend.” And he said, “And the girls, buy them -” [sound level drops and continues to fluctuate] ice cream was like a
    nickel - “and buy the girls some ice cream.” And, oh, man, we was on cloud nine. So, uh, when we got to the gym, I
    bought these girls the ice cream, and so the word was around, “He’s rich!” [Laughing] That’s what they - because I
    had a few dollars. “Oh, he’s rich! He’s rich!” So, so, a lot of the kids started calling me rich. I said, “If I
    am, I don’t know nothing about it. I don’t see - you saw the same money I saw at that one ballgame.” [Laughter] So, he
    was a - he helped us and he pushed me and all of us to do well.

JM: Was it always the understanding in the family that you’d head off to Pine Bluff and college?

JJ: Yeah.

JM: Yeah.

JJ: Yeah, that was - everybody was pushing me. Plus, the older sisters and brother at that point had gone on to Milwaukee. Now,
    they went to school as they left, but that was after they left. But in my case, I stayed there. And my older sisters and
    brother would write me letters and say, “How are you doing in school?” And, “Send me your grades.” And I would send
    them my grades, and they would send me a dollar. And, you know, back in those days, a dollar, man, you was filthy rich.
    [Laughs]

JM: I’m interested - we’ll talk about everything that’s going to happen at, at - uh, in Pine Bluff after you get there in
    ’61 and especially in ’63. But I’m curious if, um - how much the early ’60s were - late ’50s and early ’60s were
    making an impact on you, Little Rock in ’57, sit-ins in Greensboro in ’60, all of what happened quickly after that.

JJ: The one big favor, or not favor, but the one thing that prepared me really well for that is that, because Daddy and Mama
    listened to the radio and they paid attention to that kind of stuff, and they were really on top of Central High. And, uh,
    and I remember one time Mama said to me, she said, “Son, if you ever is put in that situation, don’t turn it down. You
    go forward with it.”And that was a result of - what I didn’t realize was that my mama and my aunt and Daddy - in the
    early days they had buses come through our small town, and even in those days, they were the only black folks that would get
    on that bus on the front seat and take us with them. And then, that kind of came of back to me. I said, “Oh, we
    integrating the bus line!”Because when Central High came through it kind of - and, and those were her words, that whenever
    you get an opportunity to, uh, do something for other people, don’t be afraid. Because you didn’t come from an afraid -
    she said, “It was dangerous when y’all went to weigh your own cotton. White people didn’t like that. And - but y’all
    have been through it and you’ve seen it. And you can - when opportunity comes, don’t go to the back of the line. You go
    to the head of the line and be brave about it.” Now, they all - now, they did talk about that. And, um, when I went to -
    went off to school - I had all that in my head. So, it wasn’t - I wasn’t looking for anything, but when I saw, uh - when
    I got to Pine Bluff, in the city you saw real, real segregation, because it was a city. In Willisville, you’re down to -
    in the woods- and when you’d go to town you would see it. But when I got there, I really saw it. But I wasn’t organized
    or nothing, but I saw it as I went downtown and I saw the Holiday Inns and all of those. I looked at it and I saw - the
    onliest thing I saw of black folks, they were maids. So, that registered in my mind. When I went back home, I shared that
    with her.

JM: Yeah.

JJ: She said, “Well, son, if you - I’m not going to tell you what to do.” That’s what my mama said to me. “If you, um,
    go somewhere and y’all like -” because we would travel sometimes in the sports - “don’t you never go through a
    backdoor. If whites go through the front door, you go through the front door.” Now, I heard that from her.

JM: Yeah. You mentioned a moment ago, um, that your family - you mentioned that, you know, you had gone and weighed your own
    cotton. Can you tell that story just a little bit and what that meant?

JJ: Um-hmm. Well, kids who lived on a plantation, they would work hard. And you have these ten- and twelve-foot-long sacks, and
    when you picked that much cotton, you were hitting sixty pounds, sixty-five, and some guy was really good and hit as much as
    eighty. But when they brought their bags to the gin, white people didn’t let them stay there to weigh their own cotton.
    So, they would bring their bags and drop them and go back.Now, in my case, Daddy and Mama, Aunt Nune [Gladys Martin] and
    Uncle Blufus [Martin] went to the gin. Now, my mama, dad, uncle, and auntie were gun packing black folks. They would sit
    right at the gin with them double-barreled shotguns and two shells between their fingers. And when we got our cotton,
    “Come on, boys!” And they would go up there and weigh - we would weigh our own cotton.Now, the kids who were bringing
    their cotton to the, uh, gin, they couldn’t weigh theirs. And we would sit there and watch this. Sometimes those bags
    would be seventy pounds of cotton. And these guys would ask each other, “Well, John, what’d you think?” “Oh, let me
    see. Oh, give or take, forty-one pounds. Oh, pretty good old boy. Give him the benefit - forty-seven pounds.” So, that’s
    forty pounds that were taken away from him! So, I would sit there and witness that!Now, the fun kind of thing was, me and
    Clara Lee and Jesse and all of us, you know, we felt pretty comfortable, because Mama and Aunt Nune was there with those
    guns. And so, when we weighed our cotton, we were looking quite forward. [Laughter] 

JM: How could your family get away with that?

JJ: It was - you know, everybody in Willisville and the surrounding area believed that if they bothered my family, it was a
    whole lot of killing going to take place. They believed that. Because my brother had been in a real bad racial situation,
    Troy - I’ve got his number in there. He was the only black member that went to a little town called McNeil [Arkansas], and
    he got a job working on the railroad. He didn’t - he wasn’t on a train. He was doing the hard work, putting those spikes
    and all that to keep it up. And when he went wherever they went, and on the way back when they got to McNeil, they told Troy
    he had to get off the train, because he couldn’t - blacks couldn’t - well, Negro - it wasn’t the black folks then; it
    was Negro in those days - Negroes couldn’t ride the train through McNeil’s little small town.And my brother Troy, uh,
    wouldn’t get off the train. And just like my parents, he had his weapon. And, boy, it was a hard knockdown fight. You
    know, he stabbed and cut a whole bunch of white folks. And then, they chased him and shot him up pretty bad. But he got
    through the woods and all that.And so, the white people decided that they were going to come to our house and kill him. And
    Mr. Chester [Willis] is the guy who in Willisville has the little store, both the little stores there. He told those people,
    said, “Don’t. Don’t y’all go over there. Y’all are gonna get killed.”And so, my daddy had some brothers, some
    cousins, and you have to go down through these woods, this dirt road, to get over to the farm. And about dark of night, they
    was coming in there to get Troy. And, man, there was so much shooting and so many people got hit. And I heard them
    screaming, “Oh! I’ve been hit!” And what Daddy did and his brothers, when they were shooting people, they went to them
    and took their guns. They let them go but they took all their guns. And so, it was kind of known that the McKinneys
    weren’t the folks to mess with. [Laughs] And it was a lot of them; it was a bunch of them.

JM: How old were you?

JJ: I’m sixty-eight.

JM: No, no, sorry. Excuse me. How old were you then?

JJ: Oh, eight, nine. Matter of fact -

JM: So, early ’50s then? 

JJ: Yeah. I went up - I went up to Willisville, because Daddy made the comment, said, “If, uh, if they come down here and mess
    with me, I’m going to kick their ass!” Those are exact words. So, I thought he was talking to me! And I went to
    Willisville, like a mile and a half. [Laughing] So, I walked all the way to Willisville and told this white guy, Warmack,
    what my daddy said! He kicked me! I went back home and told Daddy. He kicked me! Daddy said, “I’ll take care of that
    later,” because all this was in the making, preparing for this. Yeah.

JB: Can we pause for a second?

JM: Sure. That’s extraordinary!

JJ: Um-hmm. Oh, yeah.[Recording stops and then resumes]

JM: Tell me what it was like, impressions you formed when you arrived in Pine Bluff to go to school. And I’m thinking about -
    you mentioned already that you saw segregation in the landscape of that city in a way you hadn’t seen it before, but also
    on the campus, because that was, that was a very important black institution.

JJ: Um-hmm. When I got there, uh, to Pine Bluff, you know, that was my first big city. Uh, the campus was very pretty. It was
    real exciting. And what helped me jumpstart real fast is the school I went to, Oak Grove High School, was a very good
    school. And, matter of fact they had sent - about four guys from their school were professors at Pine Bluff. And I didn’t
    know them. That was before I came along.And my brother in Milwaukee sent me a letter and said, “There is a guy in the
    vocational school. You go find him and tell him that Charley B,” one of my older brother, “sent you.” He was a Haynie,
    Dr. Haynie. And I went there, and when I walked into his office, he looked up and he said, “I don’t know your name, but
    you’re sure one of them Joneses [laughing] from Rosston, Willisville.” And he recognized me, “Oh, yeah, you look just
    like Ernest Jones.”And so, I started talking, and then he, you know, really was telling me all about the school and walked
    around. He took me all over the campus and said, “This is one of my boys, Ernest Jones’s boys. Them boys are sweet,
    kind,” I mean he really just painted this beautiful picture. “They’re smart, and I want all of you professors to keep
    your eyes on him. He’s a good student. Don’t, don’t, don’t be putting him over there in social studies. He’s good
    in math, algebra. He came from a high school that had all of that.” Because when some guy asked me, he said, uh - one guy
    told me, said, “You might need to take preliminary courses.” He said, “Are you from a small town?” I said,
    “Yeah.” He said, “Well, what - what did you have in high school?” I said, “I had algebra. I had trigonometry. I
    had physics. I had biology, chemistry.” [Laughs] He said, “Man, what kind of school did you go to?” I said, “I had a
    school that was a very good school. Matter of fact, the, uh, principal imported - he handpicked teachers from all around to
    come there at that school.”

JM: Was Oak Grove private?

JJ: No, it was a school, but it was, uh - there were four schools in Arkansas that was built way back in 1931 by the, uh -

JM: Rosenwald School?

JJ: I think they were - they were the - it’s a group out of New York somewhere built these schools way back, because I know
    our school was opened in 1829. And the school was built, and they had the vision of folks coming, because the school was
    built with dormitories, so these teachers came from other places, and they lived right there on campus. I think the Quakers
    or Quakers are -

JM: Exactly.

JJ: And there was two all-black school districts. Mine was one of them, and the other one was Arkansas City, where Ebony
    magazine’s [John H.] Johnson man came out of. So, we had - unlike a lot of other schools, we had books, because we could
    float bonds and we had the, you know, the books not - because a lot of the white schools would give their old books to the
    black schools. But, no, we had good books and we had good teachers and everything like that, so I had a good start.

JM: You’re describing a personal history that isn’t very typical for folks in that time.

JJ: Yeah, yeah.

JM: Between - I’m sorry.

JJ: So, when I got to Pine Bluff, I was very comfortable and had met somebody that had been in Rosston, and then he took me
    around. Then he introduced me to Dr. Marshall. And Dr. Marshall was a professor on campus, and he had another little house
    right by his house. And he asked me, he said, “Well, are you going to live in a dormitory?” I said, “Well, I’ve got
    to live somewhere.” And Dr. Haynie said, “Put him in your house over there. And you’ll like - you’ll take a liking
    to this young man.” And so, we started talking, and he said, “You sure know a lot to be a country boy.” He said,
    “These country kids come up, and they don’t know nothing. We think the city kids know everything.” And so, we just
    started talking, and then he was the one told me, he said, “There are some folks in Little Rock that’s trying to get a
    civil rights thing started, and they went to Philander Smith [College]. And they didn’t have no luck there, because all
    those kids were city kids, and their parents said no, uh-uh, and they was going to get put out of school, and all that.”
    He said, “I want you to - I’d like for you to meet those guys.” And that’s when Grinage -

JM: Yeah.

JJ: That’s how I met [Ben] Grinage.

JM: Ben Grinage.

JJ: And when old Grinage came down, and, uh - Grinage and Bill Hansen.

JM: Um-hmm.

JJ: And I hadn’t met Worth [Long], but a little bit later on, I met him. So, a few days later, uh, they both came and started
    talking. And, uh, so, uh, so Bill Hansen said, “Dang, man! You’ve already done what we’re trying to do [laughs] down
    at your hometown!” [Laughs] And that’s when, uh - I said, “Well, you know, that’s how my - I was raised.” He said,
    “Man, this will be a piece of cake for you.”But then, they, uh - that wasn’t when they were trying to get it started,
    but they said that they was working in Little Rock and doing some things. “But when we come back to Pine Bluff we need to
    sit down and talk, because this is a college town, and there’s a lot of segregation here. And here you guys are down here,
    y’all got all these MacDonald’s and all of this, and the black people can’t go to them, and - and this city is driven
    by the university.” And that’s how I met them. 

JM: Yeah. Do you remember more specifically about this group of folks, Grinage and Hansen, one’s black, one’s white,
    they’re SNCC people - this is probably the first you might have heard of SNCC maybe?

JJ: Right. When we met, uh, Grinage talked about he had been involved in labor and union groups a lot. When Bill Hansen talked,
    he talked about he had been involved in sit-ins and things like that. But the first thing Bill Hansen said is, “We need to
    organize some students to challenge -” they had already been around and saw the MacDonald’s. I didn’t even know what a
    MacDonald’s and all that was [laughing], even though it’s right down the street. But Bill Hansen’s take was, “I’m
    a white boy and I don’t need to be leading it,” and that’s what he said. “But we need a black person, and you’ve
    already done all this stuff.” And he said, uh, “If you went into one of these white restaurants and was arrested, what
    would, uh, your parents say?” They would come up here and they would come to the jailhouse and they would say, “James,
    is this what you want to do?” And if I said, “Yes,” he’d say, “We’ll do whatever you need for us to do to
    support you,” and they would go back home. He said, “Really?” [Laughs] “They wouldn’t -?”I said, “No, no.” I
    said, “Because they talked to me long before I knew anything about this kind of stuff - about, you know, ‘if you get
    involved and stuff.’ And they talked about, ‘Don’t you ever go through no white doors, no back doors. You go through
    the front - if there’s a front door and white people go through it, you go through it, too.’”He said, “Whoa, man!
    Was your mama a civil rights worker?” I said, “I don’t - I guess not, because in Willisville there wasn’t a whole
    lot to do.” But I did tell them - I shared with them how Mama and them rode the bus. And he said, “Yeah, that’s civil
    rights stuff!” I said, “Well, I didn’t know it.” That’s just - to me, that’s how they were.And I remember Bryan
    Warmack was the - what we considered the rich white man in Willisville. And as we got involved, as I got involved, he was
    talking to Mama about, “You need to go get that boy, and he up there doing all of this in the black school, and that’s
    where he needs to be and not running around, blah, blah, blah.”And [laughs] so, Mama got the word. And, uh, I wasn’t
    home when this happened. They said Mama went and jumped in the car with him, made him take her up to Waldo to buy some
    clothes for me, and told him, said, “I really ought to make you take these clothes to Pine Bluff!” [Laughing] My sister
    said - and Mr. Warmack was a big white guy - she said he was freezing cold he was sweating - he was sweating so bad, because
    he knew Mama had that pistol in her purse. [Laughs]But, uh, anyway - and I told him that my mama wouldn’t do that, and he
    said, “Because in Little Rock, that was an issue.” Everybody was afraid their parents would take them out of school or
    do all this, the other, and that. That’s why they couldn’t get nothing started.

JM: Early on, did you have any instinct that what might actually end up being a problem, what did end up being one problem,
    would emerge, namely, that folks at the college would - that your president would -?

JJ: No. You know, um, I didn’t think that side at all. Um, you know, I was - I went and looked at the hotel that was
    segregated, and I went down there by myself the first time, just walking.

JM: Just to check it out? 

JJ: Yeah, just to check it out. And, uh, when I came back, when they started talking about we need to protest these places, um,
    you know, I said, “Let me go talk to some - I’ll go talk to some students.” And when I talked to them, I told them
    what my parents are like. But I also said, “Now, if your parents is going to come up here and jump on you for doing it,
    don’t go. Don’t go.”And then, Mr., um, Dr. Coleman - her husband was the principal of a high school, and he told me,
    said - I went and met with him. He said, “Now, I’ve got some young high school students in my school,” Townsend High
    School. The big high school there for mostly black was Merrill High, but this school was kind of getting started. He said,
    “These kids - what you’re talking about doing - they need to get involved with a guy like you.” He said, “They’re
    smart but they want to be thugs.” He said, “Oh, they’re real brave and they want to be thugs.” He said, “But I
    think if they were around you, you would change them.” I said, “You think so?”And, uh, so I met with them and talked
    to them about, you know, my parents and what that was like, and they liked that. I said, “Now, look. What we’re talking
    about is going here, and it may be very violent, but we’re going to be a nonviolent group.” [Laughing] So, all them boys
    said, “Aw, hell, no! Oh, no! Uh-uh! There’s going be some fighting!” “Oh, no!” I mean, “They hit you in the face
    and knock you down, and you’re just going to fall and get up?!” I said, “Yeah.” They said, “Oh, no.”

JM: Why did you think that was a good idea, the nonviolence?

JJ: Well, the way I looked at it was if you can be nonviolent, the white people would be very happy to beat you down. They would
    be very happy doing that to you. But I felt, though, that in spite of that, you could overcome it over a time period. And I
    felt that if I were beaten down, and the other kids were scared and afraid of it, I think eventually they’ll come -
    they’ll come around. Like them kids I’m talking about - they did. And I just - and I think what helped me is I wasn’t
    scared. I wasn’t scared. Yeah.

JM: When the - I’m sorry.

JJ: I, uh - my knowledge wasn’t good enough to, uh, feel that I definitely could win doing it right then, but I felt that I
    could see in white people’s faces that it was working, because, uh, I saw a young white girl and young white boy come up
    and would hit me and stuff and run. And when I would look at them, I saw them crying. I saw them crying. But they wouldn’t
    - didn’t want folks to see them, but I saw them. I said, “You know, they’re doing something they don’t want to be
    doing.” It, uh - and I saw that. And when I told, uh, Grinage that, he said, “For real?” I said, “Yeah.” You know?
    “They were told to come up and hit us, but that wasn’t in their hearts.” And I saw it. I saw then we can do this. We
    can do this. 

JM: At the end of the first day, February 1, ’63, in Woolworth’s, were you - how did you feel at the end of that day?

JJ: That was a little scary because, um, we sent - the first day we went to Woolworth, we tried to go there, it was locked, so
    we couldn’t get in. Door was closed, renovations or something. And then, what’s her name? Diane! Diane [Nash] came, was
    in town. Diane, Diane - what’s Diane’s last name? I understand she’s still going strong. Diane, Diane, Diane. Anyway,
    she’s an extremely light-skinned black girl. And she went down to Woolworth and went in and eat because they thought she
    was white. And when she came back, she said, “No, it’s open.”And when we went in, she said, she said, “Go in at
    eleven o’clock,” for some reason. I think that was a time I guess a lot of people were going to be in there, so we piled
    in there. And it was a massacre, because, uh, Diane had been through the Freedom Rides and all that stuff, and her theory
    was, her strategy was that if it was a lot of people in there, it wouldn’t hurt very well, because it wouldn’t be enough
    room. And, uh, and then, she said, “If they start hitting you, fall to the floor, and when you fall to the floor, to do
    all this demonstrates, fall toward where the people were.” So, when we did that, [laughing] all the white folks that was
    in there was also on the floor. [Laughing] So, you’re down over there, and they try to get up, and you scoot a little bit
    further, and they fall. So, it was kind of fun and a little bit scary, you know. But, uh, that’s how it went. But, uh -

JM: Chancellor Davis before too many days asks to meet with you.

JJ: Oh, oh, yeah, yep, yep. That went - well, two things. Because we had a pretty good crowd, but that was short-lived, because
    Dr. Davis called us in, and then half of the parents came to Pine Bluff, too, and they were snatching all them kids off. I
    think when they finished, Dr. Davis and the parents, three or four of us, maybe, was left. I know I was there, Nash, uh, I
    think - let me see - Joanna [P. Edwards] stayed, the girl Joanna. Joanna now is, um - matter of fact, Joanna is a professor
    at, uh, Pine Bluff College, and I think she just retired. She stayed. Um, who else? There was this tall guy from Texarkana.
    He stayed on. There was about four of us, about four of us.And then we all went to see the president, and he was pretty
    point blank. He told us the very next day if anybody went downtown - was suspended. Now, the interesting thing about that,
    now, that was kind of different. It was only about four or five of us who said we was going, but when we went the next time,
    there were about twelve or fifteen folks - in the suspension that, that, that - but they didn’t come the first time!
    [Laughs] So, it kind of grew a little bit there. And he put us all out.

JM: How did you - how did you, uh, make your decision to take that hit, to take the expulsion? 

JJ: Well.

JM: You’ve said a lot already that creates the context for that, but still that must have been not an easy thing.

JJ: No. But, uh, in my case, in my case, folks - everybody asked me, “What do your parents think?” I said, “My parents
    support what I’m doing.” And the tall guy from Texarkana, he called his parents and talked to them, and they kind of let
    him alone. Um, the guy that - this guy, this other guy, Nash, he was from Pine Bluff. He stayed there.And I was kind of like
    the voice of encouragement. They would sit there and listen to me, and, uh, “What if we get hurt?” I said, “We are
    going to get hurt, uh, but we - you know, we are like a - this is like a war. And Woolworth, they attacked us, but there was
    no jail stuff there.” And I said, “Eventually, we’re going to have to go to jail if we continue to do this.” So,
    they were a little bit afraid of the jail.And then, we went back there two or three times. Shut out. The most violent - I
    thought the most violent was when we went to, uh, MacDonald’s. I thought that was the - I think that crowd really meant to
    hurt us. And I think what helped us was, uh, the owner, um, locked the door, locked us in and turned that gas on - and that
    gas was awesome. But I think if we had not been locked in, the audience I saw on the outside, they really had weapons and
    bats, and I think they would have hurt us real bad.

JM: Can you describe that moment a little bit more when he turned the - I don’t understand when he turned the gas on.

JJ: The, uh, uh - when we were in there, the kids that was working in there, they left and went out. And we were still at the
    counter, waiting to be served, and they locked the doors. Now, the gas was not the natural gas. It was, uh - what kind of
    gas was that? That foggy - they turn that fog gas, and it burns you. And it, oh, it gets in your eyes and shuts your
    breathing off. What is that gas called?

JB: Like tear gas? 

JJ: Yeah, yeah, that’s the kind of gas. Now, what helped me with that was my brother, Troy, was in Houston. He had talked
    around at home about that gas, because police would shoot it sometimes. And he said if - the way you handle that is that
    water helps you dilute. Make sure to grab a - get hold of some water, and if you’re in a building, a commode, put your
    head in the water, and water the towel, and he told me that. And so when, uh, they shot that gas, I went to the sink, turned
    to the sink, and the water was still on. I said, “Everybody, get in the water!” And we all went in the water. And, uh -
    well, I guess somebody was close by, because the water got cut off! [Laughing] But we was surviving pretty good. But that
    was - ooo, and that - ooo, it just burns. It just burns you up. So, it was a -

JM: Who turned on the gas - the police or the owner of the MacDonald’s?

JJ: I guess the owner.

JM: Okay.

JJ: Because it was a [makes swooshing sound].

JM: They were shooting it at you?

JJ: They were shooting it, yeah. And when they came through the back, [makes more swooshing sounds], sprayed, and then
    lock-down. And we was in there, so, uh, that’s how that came about. But, uh, fortunately for us, I had heard about that,
    and we had a little water. That calmed people down a little bit.

JM: One of the key themes in a lot of this, these kinds of moments, was the tensions that are inevitable, that just couldn’t
    be avoided, in those moments in the black community. So, for example, we’ve talked about, uh, Chancellor Davis, his
    pressures, his trying to - well, I guess he has his set of motives.

JJ: Yeah.

JM: Typically understood to be that the legislature was in session.

JJ: Right.

JM: And he wanted to make sure the money wasn’t cut back sharply for the college. Um, black clergy, the traditional NAACP
    elites, the black business community, to the extent that - people have different interests and motives. Can you talk about
    sort of how -? 

JJ: Yeah. The black community came down on us very hard. There were two black business people that supported us. The entire
    black neighborhood wanted us run out of town. The, uh - Mr. Brown was the funeral home guy; he was the only one. And the
    white population got very upset with him because he was wealthy. And, uh, and he said to us, “This thing will get out of
    hand, but I’m going to just say this part right here. If y’all end up in jail, don’t worry about it. I’ll bond
    everybody out of jail.” And that’s all he said to us. That was Mr. Brown, the funeral home man.And his son - he was an
    older guy, and his son was about to take over. And, uh, and he said, “Dad, you sure you want to do this?” His dad said
    to him, “Son, if you don’t want to do it, get out. I’m going to do it.” And his son came back and said, “I’ll
    handle it for you, Dad.”The other person was Dr. - Dr. - there was one. He was a dentist, a very well known dentist, and
    of the medical community, he was the only one. And he came that evening after it was over with and he asked, “Was anybody
    hurt? If anybody gets hit in the mouth, don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of it at no cost.” So, those two were the
    only two business people.Now, where we went down, when you would go towards, uh, MacDonald’s, there was a couple of
    businesses. There was a little club there and something else. Now, those folks told us not to walk on their side. [Laughing]
    We had to go on the other side; there were no sidewalks over there. These are black businesses! “No! Get off the side!”
    So, that.Now, one thing that came to our rescue, I think, sealed the deal, is there was this guy named Reverend Allen. He
    was the pastor of a large Methodist church. And I think Reverend Allen may have been from New York or somewhere. You know
    how the Methodist Church transfers? And we didn’t know who he was. There comes this guy with this blue suit. And, uh, we
    was getting ready to go to - I think we was fixing to go to [pause] Holiday Inn, maybe, because that’s where we got
    arrested, the first arrest. And this guy shows up, fair-skinned guy, nice blue suit. And we were standing at this Holiday
    Inn. And this guy walks up and says, you know, “These are students, here to get an education. Their parents has worked
    hard and gave them money to come up here to go to school. They got money to come into your place and pay for their meal.”
    And we’re all sitting there; we had no idea who this guy was. And so, and this manager, or whatever, he came out and said,
    “Who are you?”That’s when he said, “I’m Reverend Allen, uh, the pastor of whatever this church.” He said, “Yes
    sir.”The other guy said, “Does the United Methodist Church know you’re involved with this?”He said, “I ain’t
    involved with nothing. I think these are our future.” “You need to get off the premises! Don’t, you’re going to
    jail!”He said, “If standing on the premises, just standing here and having a conversation - just take me with you.”But
    I got the impression - we all got excited - but it looked like it was something about him being a Methodist that kind of
    calmed those folks away. And then, that’s when he turned around and said, “Do y’all have meetings and get together?”
    And, uh, and Bill Hansen and Grinage said, “Yeah.” He said, “My church door is open, day or night.” So, uh, he said,
    he said, “Well, thank you!”And so, we left there and went to his church and kind of talked about what may happen, this
    might be a going-to-jail thing, because this guy had police standing back as if they was going to arrest us. So, we went
    over to his church. But we came the next day. And the next day we came, that’s when them kids from Townsend, uh, the
    thugs, wannabe thugs, and they showed up. There was about six, seven of them. Whoa!I walked over and talked to them and
    said, “Now, you know this is nonviolent.” “Yeah, yeah, we’re going with you.” And then, there was this really -
    there was this guy, this real dark-skinned guy. All these guys had nicknames. One guy was Popo, Pop, Pop Mouth, Hot Dog, all
    these nicknames. It took me a long time to try to figure out their real names. And he was supposed to been the real bad
    thug; he would fight in a minute. He said, “No.”He told Bill Hansen and Mr. Grinage and all them, “No, we’re going
    in. We’re going down with you on this one.” He said, “When it’s all over with and things done cooled off, we’ll
    get our - we’ll get our punches in then.” Said, “What you mean?” He said, “Oh, yeah, well, we know how to get
    back, you know. It might be six months later, but we know how to get back.” [Laughs] I said, “Well, look here. Don’t
    bring none of that while we -.” He said, “Oh, no. We’re going down with you. There ain’t going be no fighting, no
    talking back. We’re going with you.” And so, they are. They did that. And that was the first arrest.

JM: Some of the, uh - some of the, uh -

JB: I’m going to pause for a second.

JM: Okay, yeah.[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: We’re back on. Just didn’t want the file to get too big.

JJ: Okay, okay. 

JM: Some of the things happened pretty close in time that are both very significant. One is [clears throat] the first ever -
    very modest, but the first ever successful integrations at a restaurant table in Pine Bluff in March. But also pretty
    quickly, that’s when the arrests are going to start. There were a lot of people in jail by that March, because the police
    department switched tactics.

JJ: Right.

JM: And, um, as you were just saying, you know, you get to a point where you think, “Gah, we might now be heading towards
    arrests.” When that moment arrived, um, I wonder how you made your calculation because of what the implications of jails
    in those places in those times and so forth.

JJ: Um-hmm. I think, uh, that was a fear, a real fear moment. That, that because, you know, we had the beating and all that, but
    all that was outside. I think when we talked about the, uh, the hotel going to take us down, I think the college people in
    the crowd was real nervous. But them young guys, [laughs] they had been to jail, [laughs] and they were kind of like an
    asset. Said, “Oh, man, it ain’t no big thing. It’s just going be crowded and nasty up in there.” I said, “What
    y’all know?” “Oh, we’ve been there before.” And people started engaging a little bit. But I think that kind of
    calmed people’s nerves a little bit, just that those younger guys had been there.And then, when Mr. Coleman [principal of
    Townsend High] came by, and he didn’t go to jail, but he was standing across the street. And I think when people looked
    around and saw the faces, even though it was a long distance away, it kind of made you feel a little better, so we kind of
    got a little support.But what going to jail did was amazing to me - is that is when the jail - the jail thing is when the
    old black people came out. And we was in jail, and they had a meeting at Reverend Allen’s church. There wasn’t no
    college students, nothing like that, but I was told that church was packed! And, um, and they was talking about having to
    bond us out and all that. And Mr. Brown was there. He said, “No, I’ll go it.” And they tell me, said them little old
    ladies had little rolls of money in their bras, and some had it in their shoes, bringing in their money to bail us out. And
    I think when that church group, that old population, I think that shook the whole city, because, uh - because after that, we
    saw a lot more yelling and cursing, and white people started throwing objects, but they weren’t that close to us. They
    would be, “You niggers! You niggers,” and were throwing at us. That was a big change, because at first they was in there
    knocking you down. And so, we were, “Oh, I think that’s going to have some impact here.” Because the old people
    didn’t come out and march with us, but they would come to that church, and then they started things - they started doing
    things like going to the jailhouse, asking people in the jailhouse, “Can we bring the kids some food?”And at first, they
    said, “No.” And I don’t know who changed that, but I know Reverend Allen and some members - and, uh, when they brought
    the food down there, they let us out in this big old - you know, that part where, when they lock you up, they hold you in
    that big old holding cell before they send you to way in the back where, you know, little tight bars. Uh, so those people
    brought - they actually let us eat. You know, they had all these big old fat chiefs standing there like they’re going to
    kill somebody, but they let them bring their food in. And, uh, and I think that calmed people, because from that point on,
    every time we would go back, we would see a few more people coming and stuff like that.And then, the - one thing happened
    that was a little scary is [clears throat] on campus somebody had said that if we don’t stop demonstrating, the football
    team, the sports team, was going to lose - they’re going to take all their money. I think that was a scare tactic. But,
    man, we, uh - when we were bonded out of jail, there was a lot of girls and things from Pine Bluff were coming to see us.
    And, man, them big old football players came down there, just shoving folks out of the way and threatening to bust our
    skulls. And that was scary! Because I think some of them guys did take that serious. “Yeah, y’all go back, and if I lose
    my scholarship, I’m gonna kill you myself!” Yeah, so that -

JM: So, it wasn’t just no sports; it was no scholarship for sports.

JJ: Um-hmm, so that was kind of scary. That was pretty scary there.

JM: What was the - how did your case ever get - what was the resolution of your legal case in a narrow legal sense?

JJ: Well, the attorney for us was - what was that guy’s name, right there in Pine Bluff?

JM: Wiley?

JJ: Oh, Wiley Branton took the big stuff, everything.

JM: Yeah. 

JJ: It was a - it was a young, real small black guy had a law firm. And everybody said, “No, no, he’s not going to
    participate. He’s really got a good law -” but, um, I think, way later, I think maybe Bill Clinton or somebody appointed
    him to be a federal judge. Little bitty guy! And, um, and he walked into church - that’s on a Sunday afternoon, church.
    We’d all gotten out, and just tons of people came. “Oh, we just love you!” Yeah, right! And he came in there, and he
    just walked in and told Reverend Allen, “I’ll handle the case,” and just left, just like that.And I’m not sure what
    happened to that case, because I don’t remember going to court. I don’t know if it was thrown out or what. Because the
    big stuff that my man was handling, he was the whole discrimination, uh, civil rights, rights, and he had a big, just a big
    case, and he was appealing his to the federal level. So, it kind of started calming down. And so, we went, we went to, uh,
    Woolworth again. And what they had done is, I guess, they had told all the white people don’t come in at a certain time,
    [laughs] so we went ahead and ate.And we went back to, uh, the hotel, and the guy told us it was full. And they didn’t
    tell me, but I was told later that, uh, they told some people that, uh, “To keep my doors open, uh, and to keep me off the
    lawsuit, and to keep white people, because if the white people get mad, they’re going to destroy my hotel and all that
    kind of stuff,” he said, “Could you tell your people to come down here after dark at night?” [Laughs] So, I don’t
    know if that happened, but I know during that time we did go down to the Holiday Inn and we had a little thing, and they let
    us use a room. I never went there to - I didn’t go there to, uh, to just to spend the night. So, it, it settled a little
    bit.

JM: Did you ever [clears throat] - I want to make a transition of a sort towards, um, [clears throat] towards what will be your
    decision to take a formal role with SNCC and, ultimately, head into the Delta. And also, um, before that, did you ever
    circle back around - did you ever have any kind of closing conversation or meet again in some later sense with, uh,
    Chancellor Davis?

JJ: No, no. We were banned. We couldn’t even go on campus or nothing.

JM: Not years later?

JJ: No, no. Now, there were - that first, uh, wave of suspensions, now there were three or four kids who were suspended and
    stayed with us a while, now they went back to school a year later.

JM: They issued an apology, I think. That was his condition.

JJ: Um-hmm. But, uh, I never did go back. Uh, my wife was suspended; she didn’t go back.

JM: When were you married? 

JJ: I got married, uh, May 16, 1964.

JM: Okay.

JJ: Yeah, yeah. She wasn’t in the arrest group, but she was with us when we went to, um, the very first one, Woolworth. And
    she, um - and we went - where else did we go? Because we was arrested in, at the hotel, because she didn’t get arrested,
    but she was in the group of that first group, my wife was, and a homegirl of hers. But, uh, she never did go back. Joanna
    never went back. There was about seven or eight of us stayed the course.

JM: Yeah. Let me ask you about something that’s going to become very, very important in the SNCC Arkansas story in a space of
    a few years. But in this early phase, spring of ’63, moving forward a little ways, you mention that you meet the woman who
    will become your wife. Uh, Bill Hansen will meet the woman who will become his wife out of all of this context, Ruthie. Um,
    and so two things I’m interested in: One is what it’s like to be with other people in such relatively intense
    circumstances and reflect about what that -

JB: Let me pause for a second. END OF PART 1INTERVIEW CONTINUES IN PART 2.
JJ: Umm.

JM: One is the - your reflections and perspective on being with people in such intense circumstances, the relationships, the
    human dynamics of that kind of experience.

JJ: Umm.

JM: And also the interracial aspect of that -

JJ: Um-hmm.

JM: In your specific circumstances there in Pine Bluff, and then in SNCC Arkansas, because of what will come to happen.

JJ: Um-hmm. The, um, the involvement, the interracial involvement, made everything more difficult on the white side and the
    black side. On, on the black side, there was a lot of growing resentment toward whites being involved, because they were
    being perceived as the lead part, not black folks themselves, though that was not the case, but that’s what they saw and
    they saw a lot of that through Bill Hansen. Um, when we would go to the, um, uh, meetings - like we’d have meetings, mass
    meetings, and trying to recruit people in the neighborhood or trying to get something started - we specifically made an
    effort for me to launch it. Because when the whites would, um, try and launch it, it would just kind of die dead, no
    response, and it always would be a thing where the black folk want to hear my answers on that. So, that really stalled
    meetings and efforts to strategize real bad.On the, uh, racial - on the racial side, I think, um, there was a hardcore
    resentment in the case of Bill and Ruthie [Buffington]. Interracial marriage right there in Little Rock, I mean right there
    in Arkansas, that was just a no-no. And I think when things were getting a little quiet sometimes, when whites would see
    that, it would fl back up. That’s what it’s all about, you know. You know, and so that was a - and then that’s really
    what generated the - what generated the thinking is that we got to officially make Jim Jones the head of this to get rid of
    that, because that’s just too much of a - too much.Because when we would go to protest, there was so much focus on the
    whites, you really couldn’t get kind of through to talk about what we were trying to do, uh, because their attitude was,
    “What’s with the white boys? They don’t need to go - there ain’t no problem with them going to a Holiday Inn and
    stay. They’re just here to make trouble.” That’s how they perceived it, so that made it more difficult. And when I
    took charge of it, I told Bill, “You stay at the office and coordinate some stuff. Let us run this thing.” And then,
    that made it - the crowd was a lot more comfortable. And I think we were growing in numbers when that move was made, as
    well. 

JM: When you needed to shift into these [clears throat] more prominent, consistently prominent roles, because obviously you had
    plenty of prominent roles all the way along, but, um - and the, and the project director title shifted to you in ’64, how
    did Hansen - and were there implications for your relationship, your working relationship, your personal relationship? How
    did that go off?

JJ: No. No, that stayed pretty good. But, uh, but, uh, Hansen was a very aggressive, very aggressive person. And we - and I had
    to really shut him down a lot of times in situations. I said, “Now, there are some places we need to target,” like the
    voter registration stuff. And I made a specific point, “Forrest City, you know, Helena, West Helena, uh, Marianna - those
    are hardcore conservative hate areas, because all that part of Arkansas is where all them big plantations was.” And I
    said, “And we’ve got to be careful, because I think there are some of them, as we call them, them good ol’ boys, uh,
    see me and you - I think, uh, the shot gonna be fired at you.”And, uh, he didn’t want to do none of that, but, but, but
    me and Grinage and all of us said, “No. I’m going.” You know, “There comes a time when, you know, we’ve planted
    the seed and got things going, you know, and we’ve got our little group together, that’s okay. But for you to come out,
    you know, in a lead capacity over there, that’s too dangerous. You’re endangering too many people.”Uh, and he was - he
    was very, uh - he didn’t want to do that, because, uh, uh, though he didn’t say it and never would admit it, he liked
    that limelight. [Laughs] He liked it! [Laughs] He liked it but he’d swear he didn’t. “Yes, you do! You love reading
    your name. You love getting hit in the head, [laughs] and then run up to a camera and show the blood on you. That ain’t
    what it’s about.” And I knew when we went to those places they were going to respond to the color of my skin, because it
    was - all the whites who they knew in those neighborhoods were folk they didn’t like. “And we don’t need you to add to
    it.”And when we, uh - now, and when I got - the first place I went was, uh, Forrest City. Now, Forrest City surprisingly
    responded kind of quickly. And I think it had to do with, uh, uh, Mrs. Clay. She owned a funeral home and she had a big old
    house. And she said, “Y’all come and take that house. You can stay there.” And then, she had a sister or a cousin who
    was a principal, and I think she had that, the professional folks, you know, around her. And when we went - we went to her
    house, and she called them all over there. And we told them what - I said, “No, we’re not trying to integrate, uh,
    something here in Forrest City. But it’s such a huge base” - that part of Arkansas is ninety percent black - “and the
    voting over here is zero.” And so, I think that issue was a little easier than cracking the restaurants and going to the
    jail. But, uh - no, no, no, there were - there were some issues there, and I think the issue had to do with, uh, uh, Bill
    didn’t want to relinquish his role. But we kind of got through it, but that was - we had to get tough with him. “No!
    Stay here!” We had to do it that way.

JM: Yeah.

JJ: Yeah.

JM: I’m going to ask more about the voting work and registration work and other parts of the program in the Delta, but let me
    first ask: How did you - did you go to Atlanta occasionally? Did folks come from Atlanta from SNCC to - how did the
    relationship with the national folks work out?

JJ: Most of it, most of it was I would take trips down there, and they would have those we called, uh, coordinating meetings.
    And that’s where all the different states that was involved, had all these SNCC people, we would come there and we would
    exchange thoughts and ideas: What are you doing here, how did you overcome that, and a lot of that. So, I got a good feel, a
    good feel for it.But, uh, one of the things that I felt differently about was I thought I had a better feel for people in
    Arkansas because I had a farm background. A lot of the folk back in those days somewhere were farm-connected. And when I got
    to Atlanta and would go down there, all them boys were big-city boys, and they would just be sitting up articulating. And,
    uh, in order to say, “We’re going to go, uh, down the road to a store,” it’d take them three hours, because they had
    these educated kids, and they was articulating what they know and all the big words, and I’d just be sitting there, saying
    “What are they - what are y’all doing?”It was - I saw a lot of showing off their education and not a good feel for the
    neighborhood. That never was part of the - and when they, uh - and when they would ask me to make comments, I would talk
    very specific about the level of folks I was dealing with, and what the issues there, and that I don’t think that’s
    going to happen until blah-blah-blah-blah. And so, old Jim Forman told me one time, he said, he said, “Jones, what you are
    doing is a real direct connection to the community. That’s a wonderful thing.” And he said, and he asked me, he said,
    “Do you want, uh - do you want us to send some people?” But I said, “Well, not really, but I tell you what I would
    like to do. There is - you’ve got a group down there that’s a great singing group. Send that group up here to one of
    those meetings I have, because I have a lot of people, and they’re church folks. They’ll love that!” And I said,
    “And let’s slowly graduate.” But those guys, you know, when they came and saw that big crowd, all they wanted to do
    was sing, have a good time, and went on back. [Laughs]But, uh - but what I was doing was, uh, asking people, uh, to put your
    shoes on and let’s go knock on some doors and try to get people to vote. And then, I said also, I told Mrs. Clay, “Mrs.
    Clay, we need some - a couple of folks to run for something, but they need to be educated, they need to be highly
    respected.” And then, she told me that, uh, this guy that was - they had a little plant in Forrest City. I think it was a
    garment factory. She said, “Well, that guy over there, he’s been promoted to manager.” I said, “Let’s run him.”
    And we did, and - but it wasn’t like the mayor or nothing, but it was a position - and he won.And folks said, “I never
    thought it was going to happen.” I said, “Well, you do have to make an effort to make it happen.” And he went on and
    did real well. And I said, “And that’s what - that’s the kind of stuff we need to do as well as, uh,” I said, “You
    know, we don’t have to, we don’t have to go into a white restaurant and eat.” [Laughs] So, if somebody do want to do
    that, you know, uh, they can. You know, so, uh, so that’s, that’s - that’s the direction I went.

JM: Yeah. The SNCC program seemed to have those three big thrusts: [clears throat] public accommodations, where you could do
    that; then, uh, the whole voter registration and starting to run people in electoral campaigns; and, um, education, too -
    you were talking about the schools question, too. Um, I’ve read that the - I’ve seen the numbers for what the SNCC
    program accomplished in short order, I mean, in pretty darn short order -

JJ: Oh, yeah.

JM: Twenty-four months, less than that, depending on what number you’re looking at. Um, more people signing up despite the
    poll tax still persisting; a lot of candidates get into races.

JJ: Right. Exactly. 

JM: There’s the ’66 governor’s race outcome, which is a curious thing, because of the black vote.

JJ: Um-hmm, um-hmm. [Steady sound tone begins] [Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: We’re rolling. 

JM: Okay, we’re back on after a short break for equipment. Uh, Mr. Jones, we were starting to talk about the program, the SNCC
    program, the work out there, and the voting work, getting people into races, and let me just turn it over to you.

JJ: Now, in some cases, folks fell short in vision, because there were individuals who “public accommodation” was all they
    had in their head. And, you know, once you integrate or desegregate, and all the restaurants has opened their doors, and you
    can go in the, uh, uh, go into town and get you a room, to me, that’s finished. But we had some folks who, you know,
    looked long distance, “Well, let’s go - let’s go to Chicago and protest!” [Laughs] That’s an example, because that
    was the onliest focus they had. And - and those are the folks, uh, were in Arkansas. I said, “No. You know, no, that - we
    need to - this population needs to, you know, access voting and start running candidates, you know.” And that was a new,
    new piece to it. But some folks were stuck.

JM: Um-hmm.

JJ: I mean, they were stuck and couldn’t get off that.

JM: Yeah. Describe a - the, the, your experience across a [clears throat], a representative week, doing voter registration work
    in the Delta, fall of ’63, early ’64. What happens to you in that week? And who do you see, and what’s it like, and
    how’s it feel?

JJ: When - my approach to it is, in every community, almost every community, there is that woman, and in most cases, it was
    women, and, uh, I learned that from - that lady’s name was Derworth, in Gould, [Arkansas], Mrs. Derworth. And she said,
    “Young man, when you go into a neighborhood, um, for the first time, if there’s a black barbershop there, go in
    there.” I said, “Okay.” “And you ask for specific type people: ‘I’m looking for somebody that’s, um, that’s
    interested in politics, or knows some good people that could run for office, or they have a lot of influence.’” She
    said, “Those gossiping men in them barbershops know that stuff!”So, when I went to Forrest City, I took that advice.
    And, uh, I pulled up, and there was about four or five guys out there. You know, I think these were working people on a
    break. And I said, “I’m -” introduced myself. And I didn’t say I was SNCC. I said, “I’m part of a program, and
    we’re trying to encourage, uh, black folks to vote more. And, and, even better than that, we would like to see more black
    folks run for office.” And when I said that, the first thing came - like, all three of them said the same thing: “You
    need to go talk to Mrs. Clay.” I said, “Now, who is Mrs. Clay?” “She owns the funeral home. Her husband died, but
    she, she, she made an even bigger funeral home. That’s who you need to talk to.” And, uh, so, I have a little
    Volkswagen. I said, “Well, how do I get there?” “Well, come on. Follow me!” They like actually introduced me to her!
    And she was raring - she was raring to go! She said, “Young man, I’m just glad to see you. It’s long overdue!” She
    was all excited! And, uh, she said, “I told my sister -” I said, “What’s your sister?” She said, “She’s the
    principal over there, and just the two of us talk all the time.” She got on that phone and dialed her up.And, uh, and she
    said, “How you want to do it?”I said, uh, I said, “First of all, uh, I need a place to stay. I probably need to stay
    two or three days.” She said, “See that house right there? See that house right there? See that house right there?” I
    said, “Yeah.” “All them are my house. Which one you want?” [Laughing] I said, “I just need somewhere to sleep.”
    [Someone coughs] And, uh, man, she was there fixing people up, and her sister came over. And she said, told about this
    preacher. She said, “He’s a very aggressive preacher, but he’s by himself.” Went over there, and I said, “Well, we
    need to have a meeting.” And those two women said, “We’ll do the calling. You just go on over there.” I don’t know
    who all they called, but they had a church packed that night. And then, that’s when this guy’s name came up. He was
    there. They said, “You know everybody. And all the working folks here - if all of them just vote for him he going to
    win.” [Laughs] And that’s how they got started. So, that seed was there, but it was just sitting still, you know.And
    then, that’s when I started - uh, I said - I made a point to go back there later on, and I said, “I followed your
    advice.” She said, “In every community, there’s that type person.” And then when I went to other places, you know, I
    was always looking for that type. And I got to West Helena, that little lady over there - I can’t think of these names
    anymore - she had a, she had a store, run a little store. And I walked up to her and introduced myself and I said that, uh,
    what I was doing, and I’m trying to encourage people to vote and, and we are - run for candidate. She said, “I ran two
    years ago, but I didn’t have no votes, because these folks -.” She said, “I’d love to work with you!” And she
    said, “Park your car!” We took off! [Laughs]So, I don’t know if - she said, “Well, I’m getting kind of old now.
    But, uh, my son just finished college down at Pine Bluff, and, uh, I’m going to talk to him about running.” But she was
    able to rally those type meetings. And a few years later, after I’d gone, I learned there’s a lot more elected folks
    started - you know, that, that caught on and took off.

JM: Um-hmm. 

JJ: And I said, “Well, I’m -” uh, by then, when I went back through there and learned some things, and I met a - I met a -
    what’s this guy? He’s an attorney in Little Rock. What’s his name? I chatted with him. And he said, “Yeah, some good
    things have been going down.” He worked with - they had a health clinic in Marianna. And, uh, Bill Clinton appointed him,
    I understand, as a federal judge. What’s that guy’s name? Oh, shoot, shoot! Uh, it’ll come to me. And then, he said,
    “Oh, it’s a lot of good things that’s going on in east Arkansas, I mean east Arkansas.” And then that’s where I -
    I stayed in that circle until I left, you know, because I didn’t want to just be “accommodations,” because I thought
    we had gotten past that a little bit.

JM: Yeah, yeah. Public accommodations. Yeah. Before we turn to some of the reasons that you departed in ’65 and moved to
    Atlanta, um, what was your mood? What was your sense of relative gains, challenges not met? How were you feeling about your
    work out there in those, from the fall of ’63 onward?

JJ: Well, you know, I felt good, because, uh, I have a personality of incredible tolerance. And when I go out to do things and
    folks don’t participate or we don’t get it done, I don’t get disgusted. I don’t get mad. I just say to myself,
    “Well, we can’t win them all.” And I’ve always been that type of person. But I also learned is, uh, [phone rings]
    um, my personality has helped me a lot. [Phone rings] You know, I don’t get mad with folks. I don’t pick and choose, and
    I can take it. You dog me, talk about me, and it doesn’t bother me at all. And so, I don’t see it as a failure. You
    know, sometimes I’ve said, you know, I wish we could have done or could have gotten a bigger role of folks participating,
    but it doesn’t bother me, uh, that it didn’t.And I’m real - I’m very realistic about things. Um, I have never put my
    eyes on - when I look at doing things, I work at it hard and very diligent, but if it’s - if fifteen people step up and
    really work at getting it done, some folks - it’s just like in church, some folks, um, you can get a lot done. But some
    folks think if you can’t get seventy-five people to help you, it’s a failure. I say, “No, seventy-five, seventy-five
    people will be a problem for you. [Laughs] So, let’s get a small group that’s got high energy, ready to go.” And
    that’s the way I’ve always worked. And, and I think, uh, because I’ve, uh, I always could recruit people and identify,
    folks took off and did a lot of things.I remember I was in, uh, Georgia, um, and I went to a little town. What was that town
    called? And I went down to this little town, and this was, uh -

JM: When you went?

JJ: Yeah.

JM: When you worked on the Sharecroppers Fund?

JJ: Um-hmm. 

JM: Yeah.

JJ: And I went to this town, and there was a little town where they had a little factory, and they had left town, and everybody
    was unemployed. So, when I got there, I said, “Well -,” [clears throat] I went and met with this schoolteacher. She was
    a very prominent woman in the neighborhood, and I said, “Well, I’d like to have a little meeting.” She said, “I can
    get the people to come out.”And when they all came out [laughs] to the meeting - this is a big meeting - they have this
    big warehouse sitting there. I said, “Wow, that’s a big warehouse,” and it was shut down. So, I said, “Well, what
    would, uh - any thoughts about what you would like to do?” Everybody in this building had these big thoughts of - like
    building a seventy-five story, uh, high-rise building, and all kind of wild stuff. And I said, “Can I make a comment on
    something I see with my eyes?” “Yes, go ahead.” I said, “If a plant comes here, and y’all get a chance to go to
    work,” I said, “I see so many babies, so many kids, I don’t think nobody in this room could go to work!” [Laughing]
    So, they all started laughing and they said, “Mr. Jones, you’re right!” [Laughs] For you to go to work you’ve got to
    have somewhere to leave - you’ve got five or six kids?! I said, “One thing I would suggest is y’all need to consider a
    nursery to keep kids.” I mean, that town was saturated with little kids. I’m thinking everybody had five kids, six,
    ten!And this lady said, “My brother,” and that big warehouse? That was her brother’s warehouse. She said, “My
    brother’s got a big warehouse.” But she said, “He is such a hustler, he ain’t going to let you have that.” I said,
    “What kind of hustler?” She said, “He’s a big-time gambler, and he loves money. He ain’t gonna do nothing.” So,
    I said, “Let me - I’d like to, uh, meet him.” She said, “I’ll call him.”So, he came to the meeting,
    fifty-five-year-old kind of guy, maybe sixty. I said, “Sir, in order for this town to even think about going to work -”
    there was some other work in their little town, but they couldn’t go to work with nobody to take care of the kids - I
    said, “We - if we could build a nursing home {Jones likely means nursery] here for these kids to be taken care of, I think
    a lot of - most of these women here could find work.” He said, “You think so?” I said, “I think so.” Because, see,
    I’d already talked to this, this, this, uh, uh, this, um, big, uh, Army, uh, uh, Roberts, some place [Warren Robins Air
    Force Base]. It’s a big, big, big military, and they were hiring a lot of people, and it was common labor.

JM: Um-hmm. 

JJ: So, I said, “And that’s your warehouse?” He said, “Yeah.” I said, “That big warehouse could be turned into -”
    I said, “What you going do with it?” He said, “I ain’t going do nothing with it.” I said, “We could turn that
    big warehouse into, uh, one heck of a nursery, and these folk would have a place to keep these kids, and they could go to
    work.” He said, “Well, Mr. Jones, if you could get, get that, get it renewed, and it needs a lot of work on it, I’ll
    give it to the group.” [Laughs] He said, “I’ll give it to the group.” That’s what he said.I said, “Ladies, we
    got work to do.” They said, “What we got to do?” I said, “Me and all of y’all are going over there, and we’re
    going to tear that whole house out, tear all that wall down, and we’re going to put all that board out there on the
    street, and we’re going to call the city and tell them to come pick it up.” And I said, “Y’all ready to do that?”
    “You gonna make us do that?” “Yes ma’am, all you - every woman in town.” They showed up!And the thing that was so
    beautiful about this - when the - there was a big lumber company in this next town. And this guy had taken some lumber
    somewhere, and he came by, and all these women - pow, pow! And that guy, he said, “Come here, son. You, uh, you’re the
    onliest man I see. What - are you in charge of this?” I said, “Yes sir. I told those women we want to tear down this
    place, rip out the inside, and we’re going to turn it into a nursery, so all these women with all these babies can go to
    work.” That guy said, “Down there at the, uh -,” he said, “Down there at the, at the, um, at the - what?” Some
    Robert, some Robert, but it’s a big, um, um, Navy -

JM: Military, yeah.

JJ: Navy base or something like that. He said, “Man, they would love to have these women come down there, because they’re
    way short.” He said, “You got any money to pay -?” I said, “No, um-um. We - it’s just sweat and blood!” He said,
    “Let me go talk to my boss.” Warner Roberts [Robins] - that’s the name of the place!

JM: Yeah!

JJ: Yeah, that’s the name of the place! This, uh, this guy went down there, and it was about five-thirty he came back. He
    said, “You know what? I’ve got some good news.” He said, “If them women going to do all that building,” he told
    me, said, “All that lumber out there,” he said, “It’s been a little rained on, but it’s still good. You just - you
    take it up there.”Man! Them women built that thing, and the guy who owned it he came up there. He said, “Man, are you
    God-sent? Or you ain’t Jesus Christ, are you? [Laughing] How did you get them women to do all that work?” [Laughs] I
    said, “They’re doing it for themselves.” And we got this huge - man, that thing, that thing was about two blocks,
    three blocks in size. And so, this one lady said, “Can’t you get federal money?” I said, “Let me tell you about
    that. No, you don’t want that. If we get federal money for this, the federal government will make you put square feet per
    child. You won’t get a third of them kids in that building. But if you’re private, like you are - you own it - you can
    stack them in like sardines. [Laughs] And all of y’all that’s not working, don’t get a job, you come down here, and
    y’all become the group that take care of all these babies. And all of y’all that get a job, y’all start giving them a
    few dollars for taking care of these kids.” Just like that, man, that thing just took off!

JM: That’s great.

JJ: Just took off.

JM: Yeah.

JJ: And, uh, and long after I left, I would get little cards from folks saying, “This works so well, and we would love to see
    you come back and visit.” That’s been years ago.

JM: Wow.

JJ: You know, and it’s always just - you know, I’ve just kind of been a little gifted on that side -

JM: Yeah, yeah.

JJ: Just seeing things and just -

JM: Sure.

JJ: And believe that folks can do it pretty good themselves, you know, so.

JM: Let’s talk a little bit, as we kind of move towards our last section of the interview, um, to talk about some of the
    reasons, some of the things that were happening in SNCC nationally, how they reverberated in Arkansas, some of the things
    that happened in Arkansas, and then how you made your transition over.

JJ: Um-hmm. 

JM: Um, we’ve talked earlier about ’64: The directorship passes formally into your hands. You’ve talked about Bill Hansen.
    There are other whites that had come in and were coming in in that time, so the - I think the SNCC [clears throat], excuse
    me, the SNCC staff ’64, ’65ish in Arkansas would have been about eight people fulltime, sort of, uh, full staffers, and,
    uh, four black, four white. Um, the tensions are becoming a little more closely felt on the racial leadership of the
    organization question. ’65 is a pretty hot summer nationally, first riots and all, and the whole question of the
    integrationist model is now being challenged by lots of folks. Things aren’t, especially - you know, we’ve talked about
    economic - difficulties of moving on the economic front. It’s just getting - you know, like you said earlier, some
    people’s vision went to public accommodations. After you desegregate what then? How do you finally get to the economic
    justice issue underlying all this stuff?So, with all that as kind of prelude, I’m interested in your perspective on,
    through that ’64-65 period, how those questions played out inside your life, in SNCC in Arkansas, and how you - the
    circumstances that led to your move to move away.

JJ: Well, you know, my moving away, and, is - was, um, what I saw and what I felt was the resources and the use of people was,
    uh, dwindling. And a lot of the folks who had that energy early was beginning to drift toward going to work to make a
    living. People were getting older. The SNCC group was young and high-energy and educated, and this whole Movement was a fun
    thing. And a lot of folk was not recognizing we’re getting older, we’re becoming family folks, resources are dwindling,
    and that was a natural thing to me. But a lot of the white kids who have come down wanted that to be a lifetime situation.
    But what we were dealing with was not lifetime. Uh, a lot of the kids that we had worked with that we saw do wonderful
    things in SNCC and all of that - they, too, had hit college level and gone on.And when me and my wife - and I said this to
    Bill Hansen and all them, “Look, guys, this, this - we have done a pretty good job. And we’re going to ruin it if we
    keep stretching it and stretching it, and we ain’t doing nothing. There’s no means of income.” And that’s when folks
    started peeling off, because I think the Black Panthers and Stokely [Carmichael] and all that, they saw that Movement
    dwindling, too, and they were trying to rebuild them some little new, new, uh, new things and get it going, since this has
    kind of ended.And then, I think - to me, I think SNCC sort of, uh, went as far as its capabilities. And we had to recognize
    that we got older and needed jobs to support families, and we had seen black elected officials come in, and I thought that
    was, that was very successful. But there were a lot of folks - and, you know, there still are, still people who think we
    still should be doing that. No, uh-uh. It’s not the same. It’s changed. People have changed. No. Yeah, there are
    conditions all around, but it does not fit - I don’t think it fits a SNCC-type activity that we were doing. I think we did
    pretty good fueling folks’ growth, but, uh, I don’t think we could be a lifetime instrument for that. Yeah. 

JM: You were in Atlanta, but, um - and busy, I’m sure, traveling quite a bit for the Sharecroppers Fund, right?

JJ: Um-hmm.

JM: Yeah. Um, but in ’66 in the spring, obviously, John Lewis is ousted at SNCC, and Stokely Carmichael comes in. And one last
    thing I want to ask about kind of what’s - or maybe two things - left behind, or things that will happen in Arkansas while
    you’re now on the East Coast. Um, one is, um, Grinage is - feels compelled to basically make a statement [JB coughs]
    challenging the abandonment of the integrationist model, and Stokely Carmichael actually comes to Arkansas and has things to
    say about Grinage, in fact. [JB coughs] So, I’m interested in if you had a - at the time, you were a long ways away. I
    don’t know if you kind of watched that at that time or not. That’s one thing. The other thing is, um, uh, the emergence
    in Arkansas, in Little Rock anyway, of Bobby Brown and the Black Youth United, and if you bumped up against that at all or
    knew those folks.

JJ: I didn’t, you know, uh, bump into it, but, you know, I heard about it and knew what was taking place. I think, uh, the way
    I perceived that was that was going to be a very small faction, and it was going to be very satisfying to Brown and was
    going to be very satisfying to Stokely. But I don’t think they were focusing on anything that was going to be helpful to
    people. They were on their one-way trip and they were ego-ing on it. And both of those guys always, way back in the early
    days of SNCC, wanted to be the top gun, but they didn’t have an audience. And that’s what that is, and that’s nothing
    else, you know.Uh, I remember a long time ago, uh, Stokely was trying to carve out him a group, because he wanted to be the
    next Malcolm X. And that’s all that was. He wasn’t focused on benefits of trying to make situations better and
    different. He just wanted that, you know, that star in his hat. And I never was interested in that, you know. I think you
    have to sort of try to make a difference the best you can, but to go out there on your own and carve you out a little spot,
    I think that’s - to me, that’s a waste of time. And it’s not going anywhere, you know. It gets you a lot of media and
    all this kind of stuff, but it’s nothing, it’s nothing else, I don’t think.No, I, I was in tune and knew about all of
    that, but none of that was anything I - when I was, uh, with the Sharecroppers, one of the things that, uh, I had to deal
    with is - that was small farmers’ stuff - you always had guys who wanted to go attack the white man, attack FHA [Farmers
    Home Administration], and take their money, and just go find all the black farmers and just throw all the money out there to
    them. [Steady sound tone begins] I said, “Well, guys, that’s wasteful thinking.”

JM: Excuse us. I’m sorry.[Recording stops and then resumes] [Laughter and small talk]

JM: John, should we jump back on here?

JB: Yeah, you’re on.

JM: Okay. Alrighty.

JB: You’re on now.

JM: Okay. Let me ask about a couple of things here as we wind down. Um, you want to tell an important story about the tensions
    inside, say, the - your work at Sharecroppers, when the people have different ideas about how to go at these problems.

JJ: With the Sharecroppers, there are folks who feel they deserve being paid a lot of money - no identification of what for, but
    just to do it. What my assignment was at Sharecroppers was to go identify - in Virginia, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina -
    small farmers. And I did not deal with the inside of that mechanism. I told them I think there were some opportunities for
    them to sell their product and make some money. That’s the end I worked on. And I worked with, uh, national chain stores
    and the big chain stores. And I learned in that circle most of the stores was looking for black farmers’, small farmers’
    products. Closer, fresher, a lot cheaper because of the distance. And that worked fine; that was kind of easy. [Laughs]But
    what had some of them blocked is they’re talking about the, uh, money the big farmers are making, which was not always
    true, and shipping it all over the country, and you need a lot of volume. And they were looking over the fact that I got
    five acres of tomatoes that I can harvest four times and I can send it right here to Kroger’s, and Kroger’s will buy it,
    which is an excellent marketing strategy. They were looking past that. And that’s the kind of stuff I worked with, and
    they done well.Now, some of them ended, but that was because the older population, who was farming, their children didn’t
    want to farm and headed to New York. Well, it’s time to close that project down. And some folks don’t recognize that,
    and you have to be straight with them, say, “No, you have nobody to run the farm anymore. Don’t sell your property.
    Please don’t sell it, because in five or ten years, right here is probably going to be the home of condos, so you’ll
    make plenty of money selling it.” So, that’s the side I worked on, trying to get them to make money. 

JM: Yeah. You mentioned earlier on, talking about yourself and how you could go through this experience, you said you’re a
    realist. You have a kind of a measured sense of outcomes. And, uh, being a realist, did you ever have reason to think that,
    “You know, looked at in some ways, progress is much slower than we all would like on some of the basic economic questions,
    that maybe the - maybe there’s another way to do this, maybe with institutional racism, those kinds of built-in headwinds,
    that maybe the integrationist model we had in mind isn’t quite the right model?” Anyway, just any second -?

JJ: No, I, uh - my thinking was, in the model, I never did see it like a lot of the guys did, that, uh, the integration thing
    was, uh, was the model to go with. What I did see, though, is a lot of the white kids who came in and played roles, I would
    look very closely at. Some of them did have very, very good contacts, parents in big circles, wealthy. And when I, what I,
    um, zeroed in on: “Give us some contacts in the Northeast or Ohio, where we can possibly, um, do some things.” Do some
    things, because some of the folks in the Movement saw - when the whites came in, they thought they saw money, and money to
    be brought and put in the pot. But I didn’t. I always saw them as potential great contacts to make better outlets.Uh, for
    example, I, uh, in Arkansas, one - different kids, I said, “Look, we’ve got some - we’ve got these kids, pretty smart.
    Why don’t you -” like we had some kids from Boston, New York, and D.C. - “why don’t we go to these kids that’s
    pretty smart and looking to college? Do you in your circle have contact with schools that we might can get scholarships?”
    That’s how I used them. I never had this dream to heaven like a lot of people did, uh-uh.And I think, I think my
    background helped me to stay grounded. You know, my, uh, my parents did well in farming, but I saw the grind in it, and I -
    you know, so, we didn’t have this big - [laughs] this big trillion dollar, trillion dollars falling out of the sky. But I
    think that helped me - grounded. And I think some of the Movement people didn’t have that kind of, kind of grounded
    background, and a lot of that stuff was theory. You know, “We should be able to do this, we should be able -” and
    sometimes those theories were dependent on the government doing a whole lot of stuff. But the folks you were working with
    weren’t ready for that, at that level of stuff, so that’s how I -.And, and I think, uh, in terms of slow things, yeah, I
    saw slow development. I saw a lot of things didn’t happen. I, I saw things like, um, efforts to try and get, um, more
    nurses and blacks in nursing, and smaller hospitals in smaller towns, and trying to recruit doctors to come in in those
    areas and spend time - that didn’t happen. I was hoping - that kind of stuff would have made huge dents, because you take
    east, um, Arkansas, and you’re looking at folk going all the way to Little Rock or to Memphis, to the big cities. And I
    looked at that, but that didn’t fly. But when it didn’t fly, it wasn’t something that brought me down, you know, so.

JM: Final thoughts - any? 

JJ: I guess, uh, my final thought is my being involved with SNCC was a wonderful thing. I saw a lot of growth in people. I saw a
    lot of growth in young folks who excelled and went on. Uh, I think some people see that because they did well and moved on
    was disappointment as opposed to staying where they were and all that, just that geographical change, and you can’t blame
    people for that. I felt - I feel real good, years later, that I did pretty good [clears throat] with putting people together
    on the marketing end and small farmers. Uh, [clears throat] I think I, uh, feel good about when I left, when I left SNCC, I
    stayed in the rural kind of, uh, area, [clears throat] still working on the behalf of people. And if you look at my resume,
    every job I’ve had put me in touch with working with a lot of people, and that’s been the joy of my life. I’ve just
    loved it.Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t - [clears throat] probably could have been several other things. I wish the
    fifty thousand black farmers we had identified in the East and the South and the far South could have been given some
    payment toward - the government not allowing them to borrow money and all of that. But a lot of those folks, when a decision
    was made to recognize them, ninety-five percent of those folks was dead and gone, and that level is who should have been the
    beneficiary. And now the sons and the daughters of those folks are in Chicago and Detroit and everywhere else. Um, and if
    there is, uh, a little bit of compensation given, it needs to be very carefully done. I would not be real excited about John
    Doe in Chicago now is thirty-seven years old and does not even know who his granddaddy was that farmed seventy-five years
    ago. I don’t think, you know, that compensates who did the hard work.But I, but I’ve been very pleased with, uh, the
    direction I went in life. I’ve pretty much been close to agriculture, small towns, all my life, which is what I love
    doing. Yeah, so.

JM: Mr. Jones, it’s [clears throat] it’s really been an honor and a great privilege. Thank you so much for sitting down with
    us.

JJ: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Glad you came by, and - [laughs].

JB: Yeah, it was really, really nice.

JJ: Yeah, yeah.

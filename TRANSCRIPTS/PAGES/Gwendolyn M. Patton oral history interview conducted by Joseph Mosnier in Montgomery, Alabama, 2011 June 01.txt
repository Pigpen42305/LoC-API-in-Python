JB: Okay.

JM: Today is Wednesday, June the first, 2011. My name is Joe Mosnier of the Southern Oral History Program at the University of
    North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am with filmmaker and videographer John Bishop. We are in Montgomery, Alabama, to do an
    oral history interview for the series, for the project entitled the Civil Rights History Project, which is a joint
    undertaking of the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.
    Today we’re in Montgomery to visit with Dr. Gwen Patton. Dr. Patton, thank you so much for the welcome, and it’s a
    pleasure to be with you. 

GP: Thank you, thank you.

JM: Um, I thought I’d start today -

GP: You’re welcome.

JM: Before we turned on, we talked about the fact that, um, that there are places here in your longer story where we want to be
    sure we place some extra emphasis. So, let me pick up, um, let me pick up today with this question for us to begin. Can you
    paint the picture of, um, of Tuskegee in the fall of ’61 when you arrived to start your years at Tuskegee?

GP: Well, it was, uh, impressive. Uh, it was a large campus in terms of acreage. The buildings were, uh, very, to some extent,
    ornate. Uh, the main street leading up to the, uh, university, which we called Campus Avenue, intrigued me because there
    were no front entrances to the buildings on the main thoroughfare. So, I was intrigued by that.And then, of course, when we
    went through the Lincoln Gates, and I knew that was named after Abraham Lincoln, uh, the National Guard greeted us. And that
    somewhat - didn’t frighten me, but, uh, it bothered me. And they were very curt - courteous, but curt. And, uh, living
    with my grandmother, whom I called Mommy, on my mother’s side, uh, I knew how to be stoic and, you know, and not to be too
    expressive, and I took cues from her, and we went right on, uh, onto campus.Later, I learned that the National Guard had
    been called up because they were integrating the schools, uh, in the, uh, city, and they were to be there for protection,
    which kind of baffled me, because they were state troopers and, uh, they had never been friendly or kind. And I had some
    understanding how the state could be trumped, if you will, by the federal, by the national. And so, they were not under the
    auspices of, I think, Governor Patterson at the time, but rather under, uh, President Kennedy at the time. So, I learned
    that and I worked through that.And the buildings with no doors on the main thoroughfare, which you would assume, I later
    learned that Booker T. Washington - even though I have to make clear that, uh, [Lewis] Adams founded the school, uh - but
    Booker T. Washington developed the school, uh, and though he was called an Uncle Tom, especially by the black
    intelligentsia, uh, with his five fingers and the fist and all of that, the Atlanta Exposition, and an argument with
    [W.E.B.] Du Bois, that I learned that, indeed, he was a race man, and he built the doors, front doors, entrances, facing the
    campus, and because the thoroughfare was used by white and black people, and he didn’t want them to feel like they were
    welcomed. And so, all of the doors, if you go there even to this day, they’re faced inward to the campus. So, that kind of
    pleased me; I liked that. And then, I learned a lot more about Tuskegee’s history from subsequent presidents much later in
    life. But when I broke my leg in the car - I didn’t break it, but this mysterious car accident in 1967 - uh, I had learned
    a lot about Tuskegee, its history. I knew some before I went there, um, because when I was twelve years old, or eleven, I
    wrote my, uh, paper on George Washington Carver and, uh, and tried to dispel the myth of the “peanut man,” you know,
    that kind of reduced him. And I saw him as a scientist. And I learned about yams, because he also did stuff with yams. And I
    learned about paints and I also understood he had contracts with the paint people. And I learned about Ford, he and Henry
    Ford. I think my daddy told me that. My father, uh, Clarence Robert Patton Sr., uh, was a race man. In fact, I come from a
    race family on both sides, so I was rather astute, uh, in the history of black people, [someone coughs] even as a child.And
    so, in ’67, with all of that thinking, all of what I knew about Tuskegee, uh, Robert Moton, who was the president of
    Tuskegee after, uh, Washington - and they were building the VA Hospital, mainly for World War I veterans, uh, I mean, not
    mainly, but for black World War I veterans. Uh, there was this dispute as to who would be the doctors and the nurses, the
    professional staff. And the authorities that be, coming from Washington - we have to understand Woodrow Wilson - uh, said
    that the professional staff will be white people and the “help,” the maintenance and the nurses’ aides and the bedpan
    deliverers and removers and all of that, will be black people.Well, Robert Russa Moton, who was the president, said, “No,
    we have black doctors.” In fact, Tuskegee had a nursing program for RNs, or to become RNs, and there was Meharry [Medical]
    College, which produced black doctors. And he said, “Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. We’re going to have black
    professional staff.” And living within the confines of Jim Crow, you know, he was kind of on target.And the white powers
    that be, because they saw money, they saw jobs, said, “Uh, that’s not going to be.” So, it became a big struggle.
    We’re talking about in the 1920s now, uh, 1910s, you know, teens. And they said that, “If a black person, professional,
    crosses those doors at the VA Hospital, the Klan will be there to do X, Y, and Z,” which was violence. And Dr. Moton said,
    “Oh, okay.” So, he called out all of the World War I black veterans - this is lore, because I was not there, nor were my
    parents - and the story is that they lined the highway to the VA Hospital, the black, uh, veterans, and the Klan never
    showed up.

JM: Yeah. It’s a proud history, there’s no question.

GP: Of Tuskegee.

JM: Absolutely.

JB: I’m going to pause. 

JM: Excuse me one -[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: Okay, we’re back.

JM: We’re back after just a short break to adjust a microphone. Dr. Patton, you were connecting the deeper history of -

GP: Yeah. And so, to bring that full circle, in 1967 when I was in this mysterious car accident in Shorter, Alabama, uh, and I
    found myself in John Andrews Hospital, uh, which was on the campus, and coming through some recovery, and that’s a whole
    other story, I wrote a piece called “Booker T. Washington in Retrospect, the Father of Black Power,” which validated why
    I wanted to go to Tuskegee in the first place. And what people don’t know is that the first contemporary Black Power
    conference was held at Tuskegee and not in New Jersey. And so, Tuskegee was part of my, uh, deepening my understanding of
    race pride and race progress.

JM: Yeah. The conference you’ve just mentioned is the one in ’67 organized by SHRP [pronounced “sharp”]? Yeah.

GP: Uh, in Jersey?

JM: No, the one on the campus.

GP: On campus it was organized by SNCC, and I underwrote it. You’re talking about the Southern Human Relations Project?

JM: Exactly.

GP: Yes, which was, uh, and we called it SHRP [pronounced “sharp”]. We underwrote it.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Uh, you have to understand my role as a SHRP organizer.

JM: We’ll come to that, yeah.

GP: Okay. But it was really led by SNCC. 

JM: Okay. We’ll come to that in some detail. That’s great. We’ll talk that through. Your initial, um - obviously, you - we
    won’t stop to do a lot of the personal history that brings you to that point, but by ’61, you obviously, as you say, are
    kind of a race person. You’re very attentive and conscious about these things. Your family has been, um, quite assertively
    attentive and in many different ways.

GP: All of my life.

JM: All of your life, exactly. Um, but you’re also a student starting college and you do things like cheerleading -

GP: Oh, yes!

JM: And going to class and theater and all those things.

GP: Oh, yes!

JM: Um, is there much to - is there much that distinguishes that period between your arrival on the campus and then your
    departure to the sanitarium when you have to go for the TB period, uh, tuberculosis period? Is there much in that early
    period on the campus where you’re closely connected to civil rights, or not?

GP: Yes, because I had to communicate back to Montgomery, and you had - the Freedom Riders had come through. Uh, that’s when I
    learned some additional things about my family. Uh -

JM: This is the prior spring, before you entered college.

GP: Uh-huh, May 1961.

JM: Exactly.

GP: I call it the Mother’s Day Massacre.

JM: Yep.

GP: Uh, and the following day, which was a school day, if I’m - well, I was at the mass meeting that they held all night.

JM: Let’s back up just one sec. So, what happens is [clears throat] the Freedom Riders come into town. 

GP: Right.

JM: And?

GP: And there’s just all kinds of activity. The Montgomery Movement infrastructure jumped into gear. Hazel Gregory, who was a
    secretary, uh, to Dr. King and the Montgomery Improvement Association, uh, and dear mentor of mine, along with some other
    ladies - Mrs. Idessa Williams, later became Redding - uh, they all jumped into gear, uh, to rescue and provide refuge for
    the Freedom Riders. Telephones were abuzz with, “They’re beating the stew out of them,” you know. “Do
    something!”But not in the household where I was with my Aunt Chick [Nathalie Foster Elmore] and my Aunt Flora [Flora
    Elmore Moore], who were two schoolteachers. My grandmother, Mommy [Juanita Foster Bolden, later Washington], uh, eccentric,
    did not have a telephone. Okay? But my Aunt Mary [Mary Foster Thomas], who lived next door to my Aunt Chick, who had lived
    in Pittsburgh, was a little bit more broadminded. And so, she was a part of the Movement in somewhat of a real sense, though
    my Aunt Chick and Aunt Flora were, as well, in lending their cars. But they were schoolteachers, and, you know, the
    reprisals - uh, as well as they were kind of status conscious, if you understand what I’m saying. They were
    “schoolteachers,” quote, unquote. Aunt Mary was a seamstress, also a schoolteacher, but had made a living, basically, as
    a seamstress and a tailoress. And her husband was self-employed, you know, as a house painter.So, Aunt Mary comes to tell me
    about what’s happening downtown at the Greyhound bus station, and I want to go to the mass meeting. I knew Aunt Chick was
    not going to take me. Because I was a child of the entire family, I went to Aunt Mary’s house, called my grandparents, the
    Pattons, who were very much involved, and they were independent workers, had their own business. They came and got me, and,
    uh, so I went to that and stayed all night and all of that.

JM: Well, I have to ask you to say a little bit more, because you stayed all night because of a very complicated and difficult
    situation. Can you explain that - at the mass meeting?

GP: Well, as a child - I’m seventeen - uh, I knew there was terror outside, the Kluxers, as we called them. We didn’t call
    them KKK. We called them Kluxers; my family called them the Kluxers. But as a teenager, like other teenagers in that mass
    meeting, we felt invincible. And the adults, uh, most of whom, knew that God was going to protect us. And see, that had been
    introduced and then reinforced during the Montgomery bus boycott. We knew there was divine intervention. So, basically,
    there was no fear. Now, we saw these white men walking up and down, and down and up, you know, inside. I had no idea they
    were police or detectives or whatever. I thought they were newspaper people. And, uh, so that was that. And then, a
    youngster younger than I, Joe Lacey, uh, was summoned downstairs in the basement. And you have to see First Baptist; this is
    a beautiful church. And I later learned - I didn’t know that night - that he was instructed to crawl through the basement
    window to go to his grandmother’s home, which was not far, to make telephone calls for those who had telephones to let
    people know we were okay. And he had to crawl under the houses, and at that time, we didn’t have encasements around
    houses. The houses were built on what I call sticks, and then later on they put aluminum around them, and then later on they
    bricked them, and so forth. And later on they tore them down. Um, so that I do recall - he was about fourteen, youngster. We
    considered him young - I was seventeen, a senior, and the whole nine yards. I recall that. Uh, but we just sang songs and,
    you know, and -

JM: I think, I think that day, earlier that day, um, some of the Freedom Riders had come to one of your relatives’ home and -

GP: My Aunt Chick’s home.

JM: Yeah, and an integrated group of Riders.

GP: Right.

JM: And I’m interested in having you recount the reaction of your -

GP: Oh, my goodness! Um, so I had them over. I was curious. I had been up all night with them, you know. And, see, there were
    lots of them.

JM: So, this is the day following the mass meeting?

GP: The day following.

JM: Yeah.

GP: And, um, some of them stayed out at Reverend Solomon Seay’s home, out in Madison Park, and that’s another story. It’s
    an old black community.

JM: Let’s leave that story and tell me about the one in your family, at your aunt’s house.

GP: So, anyway, teenagers all over the city - I don’t want to make it seem like it was just me that sections of Freedom Riders
    came to each other’s homes. And my home was selected, where I lived, and I was staying with my Aunt Chick and Flora, who
    were schoolteachers. And, uh, and I was enjoying them, talking about the Freedom Movement and all of that. And when Aunt
    Chick came home - Flora taught in Lowndes County, which is the country, so she came home much later, a longer drive. And
    Aunt Chick was very smart, you know, in her dress, you know, uh, you know. And she wore these spiked high heels and she had
    a clickety-clack when she walked and poise and all of that business. And when she came home and walked through the living
    room and saw these black and white kids, or young adults, in, in, sitting on our sofa, I did not notice that she was, uh,
    disconcerted. She didn’t display that.And because of whatever affectations - and maybe I even have some of that, being a
    product of that - uh, she says, “Gwendolyn, come with me.” And I go to the kitchen. And I knew she was going to get
    cookies and lemonade. I mean that’s the nice thing to do. We call them repasts. And, as we, uh, prepared the tray, Aunt
    Chick said to me in a very, uh, admonishing tone, “I don’t want any white people in my house.”Now, I’m a race
    person, had not seen many white people in my life, my entire life. [Someone coughs] But I saw something a little different
    about - it was only one white boy, and I saw something different about him. And I said, “Oh, Aunt Chick,” I say, uh,
    “He,” I might have used - “There are different kinds of white people. They are not like the Kluxers.” You know, I
    had this discussion. And she made it very clear: “As long as I have to go through the back door of white folks’ houses,
    they are not to enter the front door of my home.” And we always made a distinction between “houses” and “home.”
    And I had to take that under consideration. And then, she click-clacked, and I’m following behind her, took the lemonade
    and the cookies out to the group, and we ate, and they stayed a little while, and then they soon left.

JM: Let me, let me ask you about your experience in, um, in the sanitarium in, um, in Lafayette, because that was -

GP: Lafayette [pronounces “La-FAY-et”]

JM: Lafayette [pronounces “La-FAY-et”], excuse me. [Laughs] Thank you. Lafayette. Lafayette, Alabama. Um, you entered the
    sanitarium because of tuberculosis in - was it early ’63?

GP: ’63, January.

JM: And were there until March of ’64 or so, a year and a couple of months. And I know that, having reading some of the things
    you’ve written that allude to that experience, it was difficult, including reasons obviously related to race. Can you sort
    of describe the essence of your experience in those months? 

GP: Well, I loved, uh, the inpatients. Uh, it was a segregated facility. You had to enter, I did, the back door, up some steps.
    I can still remember, at age sixty-eight, the, uh, banisters or whatever you call them, rickety. I was extremely weak. I
    came up in an ambulance from Tuskegee, John Andrews Hospital. Uh, I knew about tuberculosis; it was a plague. And then,
    being, uh, in the, uh, at John Andrews in the Isolation Unit, I had oxygen. At that time, you had a tent. You didn’t have
    the little thing; you had a tent. And everybody was in white, all covered up, mask, head - so, I knew this was something
    very drastic, because I really didn’t know about TB and consumption. I knew about cancer, which was called the dreaded Big
    C, but I did not really know about tuberculosis. I didn’t even know it affected the lungs. Uh, so I’m already
    traumatized by this disease.So, when I get up to Lafayette, I mean Lafayette [La-FAY-et], and it’s Benson - I believe it
    is, I have the correct name - Sanatorium [Batson Memorial Sanitarium], the front of the building is very impressive. I have
    a photo of the building here in my archives at home, very impressive. Now, mind you, I have not been around white people,
    and those few I was around were not authority figures. So, we ride on around, go through the back, gravel and “red dut,”
    as they say down South for, you know, the red dirt. And, um, the ambulance people, uh, help me out. I’m weak, weak, weak.
    And I go through this back door, which is a vestibule, but it served as an intake room. I knew something then was wrong.So,
    after the intake and all of the paperwork, there’s this vestibule. And the vestibule leads to a horizontal, perpendicular
    hallway. And, uh, coming in, I go to the left. There are patients in the hall on beds. There are three rooms. The first
    room, in which I was placed, had three beds. The second huge room I think might have had six to eight beds. You crossed that
    hall, and there was a little black and white TV that was smaller than the television that I ever had in any of my, uh, homes
    or abodes. And then, across the hall, was another huge room with about eight to ten patients.

JM: Are you describing the segregated black section of the -?

GP: And that’s the woman’s side.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Uh, the bathroom was - let me, if I can describe, you’ve got the vestibule. Then you come up to this horizontal hallway,
    perpendicular, and then after you pass that entrance to the hallway, there is another hallway that continues vertically, and
    it’s massive. At least, it looked massive to me, and glistening - the floors. And on that side, you had the kitchen. And
    then, you had the bathroom on the other side, if I’m making sense, across the hallway. I did not know that men were on the
    other side of the hallway, uh, from the women’s, uh, section. So, they placed me in the three-bed room. I guess that was
    for the elite. And, of course, it was crowded. And, um, I guess for the first six months, with shots every day,
    Streptomycin, and trying to get strength, uh, I didn’t really pay any attention to the overall conditions, except that I
    knew, when I was able to get up and walk and go to the various huge wards, I guess - I was in the private room - the two
    wards, I found it horrifying. And we would clean up! And I thought that was part of the therapy, because I now know it’s a
    lung problem and I need to strengthen. And we would clean up our own area, mop and everything, and I thought it was part of
    the therapy of strengthening oneself.And so, here it is now about June. I’m stronger. And a little girl comes in with her
    mommy, and they’re in the ward, the big - the larger ward. And I feel, uh, a responsibility to be her mentor. I had
    learned how to crochet. I had already known how to crochet, but I crocheted so much, I tatted, made lace, you know, I was -
    you know, all of that, coming from my, learning from my grandmother on my mama’s side, Mommy. [Someone coughs] So, I asked
    to be moved to the, uh, larger ward so I could be with the little girl. Her mama was very deathly ill - never, ever, got
    from under the oxygen tent.And I guess it’s about August - well, before August. No, it’s August now. Yeah, it’s
    August, and there’s the march on Washington. And we see it on this little bitty black and white TV. And, of course, at
    that time, the state - Governor Wallace, I think, was, uh, governor - and the state would just, just take away the
    television. It would just go on what we called “the blink.” But I saw enough of it to, uh, discern that this was
    important. This was about black people, it was about our rights, it was about freedom. And then, soon after that, in
    September, the four little girls -

JM: In Birmingham.

GP: In Birmingham. And that came on, because we all watched the news, because I would insist, because you had to fight about
    what we were going to look at. A lot of them wanted to watch the little - what is it, “Search for Tomorrow” or whatever
    those little soap box [Dr. Patton intends “soap operas”]. But the news came on at six o’clock, so there was not a
    conflict. And I always wanted to watch the news. And so, I then learned - I said, “Oh, my goodness! Wow.”So, then, I
    took an extremely special interest in the little girl. She was nine years old, and for the life of me, I cannot remember her
    name. And, by the way, we very seldom knew our last names. And it was at that point that I said, “Look, the Movement is
    wherever you are.” I had been taught that: that the Movement is not something that’s imposed. It’s not an
    extracurricular activity. It’s wherever you are. And so, that sanitarium, sanatorium, became my movement base. And I said,
    “Now, we need to -,” meanwhile, they were bringing magazines to us on a cart and that business. And so, my mind said,
    “Wonder if this place has a library?” And I asked, I said, “Is there a library in here?” And they - I think they
    were stunned, and, uh, and out of that, “Oh, yes!” I don’t know what the motivation was, and I said, “It’s
    probably up that shiny hall.” And so, uh, one day I took the little girl by hand and I ventured. And there were
    maintenance people, housekeeping people, mopping and sweeping and taking care of - but we had to clean up our own. Uh, there
    was a game room. You know, it was, it was, it was - uh, what do you call - splendor.There was this huge baby grand piano in
    what we would call a sitting room or a parlor. And I had taken music lessons all of my life, so I went there and I sat down
    and I started playing, [sings] “Bom, bom, bom,” Chopin, C sharp, “Prelude in C Sharp Minor.” And, you know, it has a
    real classic kind of, [sings] “Dom, dom,” and all. And, of course, the white people were just stunned, if not angry.And
    across from the sitting room - there was the sitting room. There was a front entrance and its vestibule - and then, on the
    other side of that, was the library. And I went over there. After I - after white people started looking at me peculiar, my
    little brain said, “Oh, no, you’re not going to do this, because they’ll have you up here like a toy.” And I would
    be coming up here playing, you know, which made me fundamentally no different than a nanny taking care of a white child at
    the expense of my own. So, I said, “I better stop this.”So, I go to the library and I pull out some books. And then I
    politely walk back down the hall. Nobody said anything to me. Uh, the doctor was in and out, so he was like not a real
    participant. And I guess this was the head nurse, or whoever was in charge, but she was a woman. And she came to talk to me,
    quietly, that I was not to do thus-and-so, going up to the library.

JM: White woman?

GP: White woman and all of her white starch - kind of reminded me, later on, the nurse that flew over the cuckoo’s nest.
    [Laughter] Uh, and I told her that, “I am a college student, and this is a little girl. And y’all need to work out some
    kind of arrangement for me and this child to go to the library.” And I guess there was a human inkling in her. And so, she
    arranged on Jim Crow terms for me and the little girl to go to the library. I can’t remember what days, but we would go,
    and nobody would be in there but us. And we could look and pull the books and maybe stay for about thirty minutes and, uh,
    and read the books, because we couldn’t bring them back. We could bring magazines, but not the books. And sit up there and
    read the books - I’d read her children’s stories or whatever. And so, that was my first - not my first protest, but that
    was -. And then, secondly, I got tired of the food. They always gave us “boil up” food. And what I mean by “boil up”
    food, uh, greens, which were healthy - I’m not opposed to that - but boil up food, potatoes, stew. And, uh, I asked one
    day, I said, “Uh, how come we eat all of this kind of food? Don’t y’all have some other kinds of food?” And
    whatever, whoever this nurse was, she said, “Well, Gwen, you, you probably won’t like this food.” I said, “Well,
    what is it?” She said, “Well, we’re having oyster stew.” I said, “Made with cream or milk?” And she said, “Oh,
    you -?” I said, “Yes ma’am.” I was polite. I said, uh, “I’d like to see the menu. And I think we ought to have a
    chance to look at the menu and see what you all are serving, totally, and put it on our little bulletin board.”And after
    that, she didn’t say anything, stunned. They didn’t know what to do. They were ready to hurry up and get me out of
    there. And then, I decided I’d go to the kitchen. Because, see, when you walked down the little colored section into the
    main expanse of hallway, the kitchen was right there, not too far away. And I went in the kitchen and looked. And by that
    time, I guess I had a reputation, because nobody admonished me, nobody threatened me, nobody insulted me. They were polite.
    And I looked and looked and looked and saw what they saw. And then, they started posting the menu. So, when they had perch
    fish as opposed to whiting, when they had baked fish instead of fried fish, you know, I would choose, you know, other - and
    tried to encourage my, uh, fellow patients to do likewise.Now, the other thing that was interesting about the sanatorium,
    they had a chapel - you know, a little, uh, prayer kind of room - on the glistening hallway. We had to go outdoors. And we
    would go outdoors and sit at this wooden table under a tree. I think it was a pecan tree. And that’s where we had our
    services. We never had a minister. We would conduct our own services. And the songs were always - one I remember most.
    [Singing] “Way over yonder where Jesus is, way over yonder where Jesus is, I’ve got a mother over yonder, way over,” I
    remember that, because my mother had passed. And, uh, I learned a whole lot of new songs that we never sang in the Baptist
    churches here in Montgomery. They were real, uh - I used to call them dirges of Christian music. Uh, they were sad and they
    were always about death. So, anyway, that had an impact on me.

JM: Let me ask about all this. You obviously were polite and, and, though youthful, a young adult, obviously had an air of
    confidence and assertion about yourself. Why do you think they tolerated you and those demands that you made, given what
    they might have said? 

GP: I think that they were impressed with my intelligence. Uh, I think that they had made the assumption that black people were
    ignorant and stupid. And when they could see that I would discuss with them - I wasn’t determined, I wasn’t not trying
    to raise them nor lift their consciousness - no, that was not - you know, but I would say things: “Why is it important for
    you to keep black people and little children from learning?” And I think they had no answers or couldn’t answer. And,
    uh, and they knew I was going to be temporary. So, they were really figuring on how to get me out of there and would
    tolerate me and, I think to a certain extent, respect me at the same time. Because I made dollies and, uh, stuffed, stuffed,
    uh, stuffed - what do you call - ducks, you know, little stuffed animals.

JM: Oh, yeah.

GP: And then, my folks were sending me pajamas. You see, I also had that extended, uh, support base. I’m sure they had read
    about me, my grandparents, and they knew, also, that if something happened to me wrong, there would be at least some level
    of hell to play, or to pay. And, uh, whenever there were visiting times, my folks came. Tuskegee people came. So, I think
    it’s that support base as well. And, uh, and I would make ducks and give them to them.

JM: Um-hmm.

GP: You know, the little head nurse who would come in all the time, I gave her a little duck. Uh, the doctor - I used to make
    these hard-to-crochet, um, hearts. You know, I knew how to stitch and double stitch and pickup stitch and, uh, and then
    stuff them, you know, get satin and then stuff it with cotton. And I would make little ones and I would give them to the
    doctors and, you know, and people like that.

JM: Yeah. Thank you for that description of the -

GP: And, by the way, I was the only one with a college education.

JM: Yes.

GP: Well, with some, because I had not graduated.

JM: Yes.

JB: Joe, let’s pause for a second.

JM: Okay.[Recording stops and then resumes] 

JM: That was lovely.

JB: We’re rolling again.

JM: We’re back after a short break. [Someone coughs] Uh, Dr. Patton, let me ask you about, um, about arriving back on the
    Tuskegee campus in the fall of, uh, of ’64. Um, it’s a, it’s a campus now that SNCC folks are visiting.

GP: Everywhere.

JM: Pick up the, pick up the story with what you came back to.

GP: Well, when I came back, uh, I had a roommate - cannot think of her name. But tuberculosis was considered like a plague, and
    she did not want to be my roommate. She was scared to death. I was one big fat disease. And, um, that bothered me to some
    extent, but it didn’t, because the community in Montgomery embraced me. I got a job in a cleaners, uh, between, you know,
    convalescing. And, uh, I had sense of humor. My folks loved me. They would make it their business to drink a, a glass of
    water from my glass of water. You know, they didn’t put any, uh, disinfectant in the water.And so, I have to always have
    this background story: So, one day I’m at - I’m staying - where am I? I’m staying with Mommy. But I’m at my Cousin
    Flora and Aunt Chick’s, the la-de-dah teachers, and, uh, and, uh, and I’m eating there and I’m washing dishes and I
    pour some, uh, Clorox in the water. And they say, “Gwen, you don’t have to do that,” you know, being very - what do
    you call - somewhat paternalistic and caring and loving. I say, “Oh, yes, I do.” And they said, “No, no, we love you.
    That’s okay.” I said, “I don’t need to catch a cold from one of y’all. I might get TB again!” And they all
    laughed. So, I kind of, you know - so, I was prepared.But when this roommate acted such a fool and trying to make me into a
    big fat germ, I asked for her to leave or to put me somewhere else. And so, the school - I was in Travis Hall [Dr. Patton
    intends to say Tantum Hall], which is the honor dorm - so, the school moved her. So, I was - I had my own room, you see, so
    I was really privileged. Everybody else had a roommate but me. So, when the SNCC people would come, the women, they could
    all stay in my room! And they did. And they all knew I’d had TB and - you know. And they never made an issue out of it.
    You know, whatever cake my grandmama sent, they ate it. If I bit off of it, they bit, and all. So, it was that sisterhood
    that gave me even further strength from the greater community. 

JM: What did you make of these - let me ask, what did you make of these SNCC women? 

GP: They were tough. They were tough! Committed, resolute, but sometimes, uh, I thought that they - sometimes I thought maybe I
    was too deep, you know, that maybe there was something wrong with the way I was thinking, because I was never for
    integration, ever, in my life.

JM: What were you for instead?

GP: Desegregation. Equal opportunity. Fairness. Justice. And see, that goes all the way back to when I was in high school. I
    graduated from high school in Montgomery. And they wanted me to go to the University of Alabama, because I -

JM: “They” being -?

GP: The school authorities, uh, the principal and my history teacher and my government teacher and all - because I had, because
    I was “up,” from “up North.”

JM: It’s still a black high school at that point.

GP: Yeah, but I’m in a black community up there.

JM: Yes. Yes.

GP: But they don’t see that. They saw that I was from - even though they don’t even know about Inkster [outside Detroit],
    but Detroit, so they made these assumptions. And, uh, so they assumed that I would know how to interact with white people
    and not be frightened or afraid or whatever, which I would not have been. But I didn’t see the sense of - going to the
    University of Alabama for what? How has the University of Alabama distinguished itself? You know, all of my life I’ve
    learned about George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington, yams and peanuts and science. You know? What -? [Sighs]So when
    they said, “Well, there’s football and Bear Bryant;” I said, “Oh, can I be a cheerleader?” And they considered
    that frivolous, and I wanted to be the world’s best cheerleader. I mean that was, like, an avocation of mine before I was
    in this mysterious car accident. So, they said, “Don’t be frivolous, Gwen. Don’t be silly.” So, when they said that,
    I said, “Well, I’m not going up there.”So, getting back, if I can make the story whole, I was never for integration
    for the sake of integration. And, then, you have to also understand my upbringing. You know, I didn’t think I learned any
    better sitting next to a white child. You know, that was not my paradigm. I didn’t define myself in juxtaposition to white
    people. And that was reinforced with my grandmother, which goes all the way back to ’56 on the bus boycott - I mean on the
    bus. 

JM: After the boycott.

GP: After the boycott.

JM: Right.

GP: And she always sat in the back, and I would always sit up in the front and aggravate white folks, they were sitting there,
    squirming and pushing and all, being a kid. I’m fourteen at that time, fifteen. And one day, there were no white folks on
    the bus, so I went and sat in the back with Mommy. I said, “We walked all these years, all these days you walked, and my
    mama and daddy sent money and shoes and doo-dah-to-doo, and you still sit in the back!” I thought she was capitulating,
    that she - I knew she was a block captain, I knew she was in the Movement, I knew she thought voting was important. [Coughs]
    But I still thought, “Maybe you are afraid of white folks in a certain kind of way.”And she, very ladylike, extremely
    ladylike, who had far more class than my la-de-dah teacher relatives, and she always called me Gwendolyn, the whole name,
    not Gwen, but Gwendolyn, very proper. Uh, and she said, “Gwendolyn, the bus boycott was not about sitting next to white
    people. It was about sitting anywhere you please. And I am pleased to sit here.” And I had to sit back and take that in,
    which altered my whole thought process.So, when I meet SNCC people, all the men and women, in ’64 - this is before Black
    Power - and they were about integrating and thus-and-so, I had a different kind of perspective. But I knew these were some
    good people. They were dedicated. And maybe I needed to look at my perspective, as well, to understand, be self-critical,
    which never - but did not - I did not alter. Because the more I saw, the more I said, “This is silly.”And it began with
    the desegregation of schools in Macon County. You know, they were getting the middle class kids, the professional children,
    to integrate the white school, which was downtown Tuskegee, when the poor black and the poor working folks lived in downtown
    Tuskegee so they could have - what - walking distances to the white folks’ homes to clean up, take care of the chillen
    [Dr. Patton’s purposeful pronunciation], and the husbands to be the yardman or the handyman. So, why are we going way over
    here in a bourgeois subdivision, which is going to require busing, when we’ve got black chillen [Dr. Patton’s purposeful
    pronunciation] right over here? So, that was my first, “Oh, no, it ain’t about integration.”No, these folks - and
    then, at Tuskegee, you had the Negro swimming pool, where the professional, you know, chillen, and the, uh, VA and Tuskegee
    Institute chillen - and I use that word, uh, purposely - swam in the Negro pool, let’s say on a Monday and a Wednesday,
    and the poor and the working class Negro children swam in the same pool on a Tuesday and a Thursday. So, I saw right away
    the class problem in the caste. And I had to just really struggle with this thing, integration, and integration for whom?
    And so, I just had a different perspective. 

JM: Sure. Let me ask about - [clears throat] some of these, some of these very thoughts are right at the front of your mind, I
    imagine, when you are sorting out with SNCC the creation on campus of TIAL.

GP: Right.

JM: In early ’65.

GP: Yeah, I didn’t believe in submerging. And, see, that comes, goes all the way back -

JM: Yeah, describe that, “didn’t believe in submerging,” a little more. Can you explain that in a little bit more detail?

GP: You should not - you should not take the identity of a grassroots organization. You should not subsume them. As an
    organizer, you should do everything to lift them up so they can have their own identity, their own structure, their own
    sense of how they’re going to run that community organization. Now, that didn’t come to me, uh, as a brilliant thought.
    That came to me as a result of MIA [Montgomery Improvement Association].When the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
    formed in 1957 at my church - I talk Southern, I like Southern “chuch,” we say “chuch” - uh, Hutchison Missionary
    Baptist Church, and they wanted the MIA to become a chapter, an SCLC chapter. And my grandparents and the folks whom I, uh,
    respected and had worked with [clears throat] as a child and as a teenager said, “No. It was a Montgomery Improvement
    Association that spearheaded and directed and kept together the three hundred and eighty-one days we walked. We are not
    going to give up that identity.” And to this very day, we have never had an SCLC chapter. But we still have MIA.So, I’m
    coming from that experience and bringing it to SNCC. Now, we have an organization. It’s called the Tuskegee Institute
    Advancement League, TIAL. We were here before you got here. We were involved in direct action. I was a direct action chair.
    You know, we’ve got a movement. We’re not only fighting the race question, we’re fighting the class question within
    black people, which they had not a clue, because they assume all black folk were alike, and we saw the sharp distinctions.
    Uh, Dr. Foster, [clears throat] who was president of Tuskegee, and I have him on, uh, video, by the way, uh, in the
    archives, would have a Christmas party. See, Tuskegee was really a very bourgeois school. We didn’t wash. We had a laundry
    on campus, and they would come and collect our clothing and our linen and wash it and bring it back. I mean, it was a very
    “bourgie” school, as close to a prep school as you could get. But Dr. Foster, the president, would have the laundry
    people, the maintenance people, uh, the, the, uh, the help on, uh, the grounds - not the grounds superintendent, you know,
    he was in the bourgie class - at one Christmas party, and then the professional and the VA people at another Christmas
    party. [Clears throat]So, when I became student body president, which I’m leaping, I would always talk to him about cost
    effectiveness. And that became a principle of mine as we interacted, and we became very close. I said, “You know, it costs
    far more money [clears throat] for you to have two distinct Christmas parties than if you had one.” And he, being a
    businessman, you know, [laughs] with a PhD, probably a Masters in business - I don’t know what his PhD was in, because I
    don’t know if they had PhDs in business at the time - he could look at the bottom line. And he began to reason with me,
    and soon afterwards we almost became peers. But I respected him as an authority.

JM: Yeah.

GP: And, plus, he had impeccable grammar. In fact, all of the black presidents - not all, but many - would send their writings
    or speeches to him for him to proofread and edit and all that, and I was impressed, you know, with his, uh, his grammar.

JM: There’s so much activity on the campus in the fall of ’64, early ’65, but let me take the story to, um, to March,
    March ’65. Um, your election as president will follow, but you are a very significant figure in organizing inside TIAL and
    a campus figure. And, um, can you tell the story of those several weeks in March, from Bloody Sunday through the Alabama
    state capitol?

GP: Well. [Clears throat]

JM: Well, you’ll see the Alabama state capitol a couple of times, because -

GP: Yeah, the march that didn’t turn around.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Uh, Tuskegee had become a liberated zone.

JM: By which you mean -? How did it feel? 

GP: SNCC stayed wherever they wanted to, they went to classes, they ate in the dining hall - uh, you know, the whole nine
    yards.

JM: So, that is to say, that the administration had given up an effort to -

GP: Had totally given up.

JM: Right.

GP: And we had, uh, faculty support - Jean Wiley, Maggie Magee, uh, Dean [Richard] Wasserstrom. Uh, it was a very, uh, complex
    situation, because Dr. Foster had hired all of these white people who were progressive, which always fascinated me, because
    most white people who come to black college campuses are progressives, you know. Uh, and Jean Wiley was black. Uh, so they
    displaced the black professionals. I’ll never forget that. So, I had a meeting, later on when I was student body
    president, of black and white professors getting together to see if we could work this thing through, because the black
    professors were becoming nationalists, you know. And the white professors were our buddies, you know, they, you know. So,
    anyway, that’s another story.But prior to, uh, uh, the march from Selma to Montgomery, SNCC, as I said, was everywhere on
    campus and had freedom, you know. And, uh, Dr. Foster, really not knowing what to do, and Tuskegee being a quasi-private and
    public institution, the state had no authority, you know, Governor Wallace and the state apparatus. [Clears throat] So, uh,
    students would go to Lowndes County, go to Dallas County, you know, and help organize. And that made sense to us, because we
    were now toying with the whole concept that education has to be relevant. And if you’re not serving the community, then
    what good does it mean for you to get a degree?And, uh, so we would win those arguments intellectually, and we played
    excellent chess. I was a real excellent bridge player. You know, so it was all of that, if you can see the complexity of
    what we were becoming. Plus, our professors had us read, uh, de Tocqueville. When you read that, I mean, how are you
    supposed to come out of that? You know? And then we had - Negro history was compulsory, you know. [Laughs] So, when you
    read, uh, Du Bois, whatever his limitations, or Booker T., whatever his limitations, how are you supposed to come out of
    that? I mean, I thought education was to inform you and change your behavior. And so, it changed our behavior to be more
    revolutionary. You know, uh, I dealt with the whole question of homosexuality. In fact, my sophomore paper was on
    homosexuality. I went to look that up in the card catalogue at the time, and it always said “deviant behavior.” And I
    had a cousin, Bobbie, uh, who lived with me while I was in Inkster, at Wayne State [University] in library science, who was
    in love with a neighborhood family friend that my brother and I knew was a sissy, because that’s what we called him, a
    sissy. His name was Junior; his name was Robert Harris. They’ve both died, so I can call their names. And we loved Junior.
    We called him Junior and we loved him. But we could not understand why Bobbie couldn’t see that he was a sissy. We
    didn’t know gay; gay was not a term. And, anyhow, she got pregnant, so we said, “Well, maybe he ain’t,” right? We -
    you know. And they had a son and, uh, they got married.So, I’m still close to Junior, and I ask him one day, “Are you a
    homosexual?” And he looked at me and admitted it. So, I said, “I want to write a paper on this,” I said, “Because
    when I look in the card catalogue, all I see is ‘deviant behavior.’ And you ain’t deviant to me. You’re a lot of
    fun. I love you. You know, so tell me.” That’s when he told me about the Mattachine Press [“Mattachine Review”] in
    San Francisco. That’s when he told me a book, something with, uh, “Twilight,” I can’t recall. It was a, uh, almost
    like a Bible to the, uh, gay world, male gay. Uh, “Twilight” or something, it had something to do with stars. And he
    told me what to read and Mattachine Press [“Mattachine Review”] and San Francisco and all of that business. So, I’m
    open to that now.I’m not quite opened up to lesbians just yet, because - and we called them dykes then, “bull dykers”
    or dykes. But I was opened up to homosexuality. And that’s when I learned - when I read about it, that’s when I learned
    about Lesbos. I’ll never forget that. And then, I learned the clinical term if you - I shouldn’t use the word
    “clinical,” the, uh, what is - I shouldn’t use that term at all. Lesbos lesbian. So, I began to at least peek through
    that.So, I don’t know how I got to this, but coming to SNCC, uh, I don’t know if they were so much in the heat of the
    day, uh, that they didn’t do a lot of thinking or contemplation like I did and maybe others, that they weren’t quite
    there.

JM: This -

JB: [uncertain short remark]

JM: Can we pause for just a moment? Excuse me.[Recording stops and then resumes]

GP: Okay. Those facts off the record?

JM: Excuse me, I’m sorry. Excuse me. 

JB: Okay, we’re back.

JM: Okay, we’re back. Please.

GP: Well, I have to be careful how I say this. So, in TIAL we had these kinds of discussions about people, personalities,
    identities, lifestyle. George Ware, who was from Buffalo, New York; George Davis, who was at that time from Providence,
    Rhode Island; Sammy Young, who had gone to school, uh, up in New Hampshire - Andover? No, he didn’t go to Andover. He went
    to one of those prep schools.

JM: These are enrolled students at Tuskegee.

GP: Enrolled, my classmates.

JM: Who were part of your circle.

GP: My peers.

JM: Exactly, right.

GP: Uh, the girls were Ruby Taylor, who was basically - she was from the black belt here in Alabama, Pickens County. Other
    girls: Kathleen Neal, later Cleaver, was in and out. She had been to a prep school. You know, in other words, there was a
    broader - what do you call - perspective and different levels on the spectrum of understanding. And we could have those
    discussions within TIAL. SNCC was so caught up in the heat of the day that we very seldom had philosophical discussions at
    that time.

JM: Much more tactical.

GP: Yeah, much more tactical: how to dealing with SCLC; they, you know, usurping; grassroots organizing, day in/day out;
    drudgery. You come home. You’re tired. You know, you’ve been beaten, you know, by a Kluxer or a sympathizer, a Klux
    sympathizer. You know, and so you didn’t have that luxury. Uh, even though SNCC did do a great deal of talking, or as we
    would say, “gret deal of talkin,’” but it was all about [speaking in flat voice], “Who are you? Where do you come
    from?” And I don’t know what that was about. It was an integrated group.

JM: It sounds like you’re just about, just about to crystallize that notion of the scholar-activist.

GP: Oh, yeah, we had done that.

JM: Yeah, yeah. 

GP: You know, you couldn’t be dumb. You know, you simply could not be dumb. You could not be in the struggle, in the Movement,
    if you were not doing well in school. The Movement could not have, uh, insolent, uh - I hate to use the word “dumb,” but
    that’s, you know, the vernacular - uh, but undisciplined, uh, unaware kinds of people.

JM: Didn’t you have to once, on that point, uh, answer - was it Stokely Carmichael who put that question to you - about is
    your education really valuable, shouldn’t you drop out and -?

GP: Oh, yes! Oh, yes. Oh, oh, Stokely! Stokely really tried to get all, because he was impressed with Tuskegee kids. Uh, plus,
    we had also told the administration, “This is what we are going to do. You know, we are Freedom Fighters. This institution
    has prepared us to be Freedom Fighters.” I mean, we were just, not in arrogant terms, but in rational terms, I mean,
    “What do you expect?” And Stokely was impressed with that. I’m sure they had that at Howard [University]. And it
    looked like they could have had it at Howard even better, because they had a president who was already - Thurgood Marshall
    and all of that. And perhaps they were intellects, but they dealt with it as an elitism thing. I know where Stokely and
    Thelwell and all of them were coming from.So, and they had - also SNCC people, and SNCC men, in particular, had almost the
    same kind of attitude towards Southern blacks as a variation of how those white folks saw me at the sanatorium. We were
    Southern. We were supposed to be country. They had stereotyped us not to be deep thinkers, let alone make analysis. Uh, and
    I think that kind of set them aback. And Stokely, uh, wanted everybody to drop out and join SNCC. And I confronted him, I
    say, “You went back to Howard and got your degree. How dare you do that?”Because also I saw a practical side. We needed
    the - the same reason that I had to tell Bettina Aptheker when she came down back in some years, so I guess that was ’66,
    prior to my breaking my leg. And she was astonished that we had an ROTC and that we weren’t picketing. And I said, “Oh,
    no, no, no, Bettina.” And I became very close, and to her father and her mother. I said, “These kids go to school.”Oh,
    I know what it was! Bettina had come down, and we had this grand parade of all these ROTC folk, and, uh, General [Daniel]
    “Chappie” James [Jr.] was leading, or General Benjamin O. Davis, because they both were Tuskegee Airmen and Tuskegee
    graduates. And Bettina was horrified! And, uh, I said, “No, no, no, Bettina.” I said, “A lot of these students here
    need ROTC to get scholarships. It’s just that simple.” So, it was a practical thing that Tuskegee kids had, as well as a
    philosophical underpinning. And I don’t think SNCC people understood that very well, nor did antiwar people later. Because
    we had one of the best draft counseling centers. You know, we knew how to do CO, conscientious objectors.

JM: We’re going to get to that. 

GP: Okay.

JM: Let me -

GP: But getting back to Stokely, Stokely could not argue.

JM: Even let me take you back, just for, just for, just for economy of time, because I know that we’re pressing against your
    day and when you need to leave this interview. So, let me have you talk about that march of ’65, from Bloody Sunday
    through - you will go ultimately, well, you’ll go on Wednesday from buses, on buses from Tuskegee to Montgomery, and then
    you will go and make the march also?

GP: Yeah, yeah.

JM: Yes. So, tell me about that, those critical days.

GP: Okay. We’re organizing for the march, uh, with SNCC people in Dallas County and so forth. I’m in meetings, as direct
    action chair of TIAL, with Jim Forman and others, Hosea, uh, Dr. King and all, in Birmingham, at A.G. Gaston Motel, and it
    was decided that we were going to leave, kick off that Sunday, and we were going to march until we got to Montgomery. We
    thought it was going to be three days, [laughs] you know, we had no idea. And, uh, and that had been decided democratically.
    So, even though we were philosophical, we were practical, we were also idealistic. This is what we had decided. So, we come
    back to Tuskegee and we are going to organize the east black belt.

JM: East black belt, right.

GP: Okay? Not only Tuskegee, Macon County, but also Bullock County [Alabama], which included Union Springs, which is a black
    belt county. And so, Sammy takes the lead in that, Sammy Young, uh, raising money and stopping cars on what we called Campus
    Avenue, the main thoroughfare at the stoplight, collecting buckets of money. See, we were also very organized.We were far
    more organized than SNCC, by the way, in terms of logistics. I was so concerned about the scholar-activist concept that you
    could not cut classes and go on a demonstration. So, we had to figure out who had cars. We didn’t have that many cars, so
    we had to figure that out and do a grid, you know, a matrix or whatever. And you would go and picket downtown at the
    supermarket or the registrar’s office every hour - we had transportation every hour on the hour, so you would not miss a
    class. SNCC was just, I mean, just, I mean, just like, uh, what do you call, uh, startled, if you will. But Forman, who is
    an organizer and a tactician, marveled at it, and so, he really became the, uh, the mentor for TIAL kids on campus. Stokely
    soon left and went to Lowndes County, because he couldn’t deal with the rural, you understand. The stereotype fit. Oh, I
    don’t know if I want this on the record or not. But let - that’s an assumption on my part. And they were practical
    people, deep common sense, you know, self-taught, were philosophical, still are - and their way of being philosophical:
    “Let me study that.” That meant they were going to go in deep thought, think out all of the possibilities, you know, the
    obstacles and so forth. And I think people romanticize that. But anyway, Forman became the key person at Tuskegee, and
    Stokely became the key person in Lowndes County, for whatever reasons.So, Bloody Sunday happened, and we see it on
    television in the dorm, uh, because we were not there then. And we were horrified, like the rest of the nation and the
    world. So, we’re really going, we really, we really, we’ve got to really gear up, get our stuff organized, organize the
    community, get cars. You know, we’re going to Montgomery! We’re going to meet them and, uh - because we thought it was
    going to be Wednesday. You have to remember three days; we thought it’d take three or four days.And, uh, that Tuesday, I
    think it was, Dr. King knelt, prayed, and turned around. Unprincipled! It had been agreed upon by the collective that we
    were going to do this march. Naïve youngsters: “How could he do that? He promised!” I mean, we almost went into
    infantile, you know, behavior. “He promised!” You know how little children: “But you promised! How can you break your
    promise?” I mean, we were - then we became fortified.

JM: But you were very angry.

GP: Oh, I was mad as hell. That night -

JM: Tuesday night.

GP: Judge Johnson, Frank Johnson - they just put a big thing up there, and I give him credit, because he did a lot of things
    subsequently, you know, around mental health and jails and so forth, his pen was a mighty sword - issued this injunction. I
    was too angry. And Dr. Foster - and I’m still being called in. Oh, we had deposed the student body president, because he
    was from New York and he was not a part of the Movement and would not put the student government at the disposal of the
    Movement. So, George Ware, from Buffalo - and this other guy was from New York City - deposed him, and George Ware assumed,
    uh -

JM: Control of the student government. 

GP: Student government. But he had no power, because he couldn’t deal with the money or anything, right? But at least we had a
    space. [Clears throat] And George was in graduate school, chemistry - he was brilliant, brilliant! Still is brilliant. But
    Dr. Foster, uh, uh, chose to deal with me - a woman, had TB, you know, whatever his thing. He thought I was a little bit
    more malleable, not knowing where I was coming from. And, uh, and so, he called me in. I’m direct action of TIAL, too, so
    I gave him the hook.And he said, “Gwen, you cannot march. There is an injunction.” We said, “An injunction? What is
    that, a piece of paper?” And he showed it to me, and I looked at it. And I looked at it and I said, “Oh, okay.” And he
    had copies made and put it in the dining hall on the chairs. But we had already organized this caravan and the buses. So,
    uh, I paid him no mind, no attention, nor that piece of paper. I didn’t even read the piece of paper, but George Ware read
    the paper, brilliant.So, we get on up and we tell him, we tell him, I said, “We’re going. Now, either you come and go
    with us -” we had organized the cafeteria workers, and I’m sure Dr. Foster had something to do with that. But we had
    organized them, and if he had not agreed, there would have been a little strike by them. And my buses came; we had paid for
    them. The cars - the community was organized. We must have had about thirty or forty cars in the caravan, because we
    believed in organizing totally. That was my whole thing, because I had come what - from the Montgomery bus boycott. You’ve
    got to have - the word at that time was a “base.” And the cafeteria folks fixed us little bologna sandwiches and an
    apple and a little paper thing of juice and so forth. And we come on down to Montgomery!

JM: It’s on Wednesday the tenth.

GP: Wednesday the tenth. Forman’s book chronicles it very, very well. And, uh, so here we are in Montgomery. George had read,
    Ware - and perhaps George Davis, too - had read the injunction very well, and it said nothing about a march coming from
    Macon County to Montgomery. It was only an injunction from Selma to Montgomery. So, they were able to play the legal.
    Meanwhile, of course, they put us in jail. And, uh, you know, Dr. King and them are furious with us. And this Montgomery
    community turns on us, the bourgies, at Dexter [Avenue Baptist Church]. That’s a whole other story! They never had a mass
    meeting at Dexter!And I can tell you a whole story between Dexter and First Baptist, where we were kept out, kept all night
    in 1961 with the Freedom Riders, and how those two churches split. Dexter was an offshoot of First Baptist, a very lovely,
    beautiful church, ornate, pipe organ, terra cotta ceilings, you know, stained glass windows. The preacher there, who did all
    of that, was called Reverend Stokes. He was a mortician [clears throat] but he was a race man. And if you go there to this
    day, he put those stained windows up, the pews from Italy, the whole nine - the pulpit. If you look at the window, one of
    the stained, huge - there is John the Baptist baptizing Jesus, right? And above that pane is Reverend Stokes. Okay? You hear
    me talking about a race man? And, uh, so I have all these great stories. And when you go in there, uh, the church, by the
    way, the architect was from Tuskegee. Uh, the ceiling, the attic, is eight feet in depth.So, down the road apiece, in which
    my grandfather built, one little town was called New Town - initially was all plantation. And so all of the folks out on,
    down the hill, what they call North Montgomery, Powder Town [Dr. Patton intends to say Pumpkin Town], New Town - and my
    granddaddy built a lot of those little shotgun houses - [someone coughs] uh, would come up to the church with their overalls
    and whatever.And then, you got - now, you’re getting a few little doctors - well, not too many doctors, no lawyers, but
    you’re getting these la-de-dah schoolteachers, and they don’t want to be bothered with those field hands. So, they get
    angry and go to Dexter, which is “downtown” and right up the street. All of this affectation, this status foolishness,
    and for years, families was like - uh, what do you call, when you have family feuds, family split, you know, based on
    superficial class stuff?And it was only until Dr. King, who became pastor at Dexter - and they did not support nothing,
    absolutely nothing, the high-falootings - became dear friends to Reverend Abernathy, who talks with a diphthong, [imitates
    Reverend Abernathy], from black belt - I think he was from Marion, Perry County. They became close, then the churches became
    close, and then families became close. That’s the story behind Dexter.So, here we are on a March, cold, rainy, drizzly
    night, and we take refuge.

JM: Because you asked to see the governor. He refuses.

GP: Oh, he puts George Davis and all of them in jail!

JM: And I’ve got to say a couple of other things here. Tell, recount for this tape how many people you mobilized from the
    campus.

GP: Uh, I think we had twenty three hundred students at the time. That I remember. About fifteen hundred.

JM: Probably about fifteen hundred in Montgomery.

GP: Yeah. 

JM: That’s extraordinary.

GP: All we had to do - we had it organized. We would be in the dining hall, and we would begin to stomp our feet on the floor.
    And that meant we had to all go to the valley, because we were about to have a mass meeting. You know, and everything was
    done democratically. We had to vote on everything, you know, all of that. We were not involved in iconic leadership. Uh,
    there was no thing around women that I knew about at the time. Uh, it was all about if you had the skills, the analysis, if
    you could persuade, you know, uh, not so much persuasion but persuasion by reason, you know, then you became a leader.

JM: Take me back to Dexter.

GP: So, for some reason, the church was open. I don’t who - if they were locking churches or not at that time - or if somebody
    broke it. I don’t know. But we were in Dexter.

JM: As a refuge of sorts.

GP: As a refuge, yeah. It was cold. It was drizzling. We had no bathroom. You know, Forman does the great pee-in. And all of
    these little silly tactics that the state troopers would do, and then the city police and the county and, you know,
    they’re playing all silly games. And we’re about tired and tired of fooling around with all of their little foolishness,
    the authorities’ foolishness. So, we go to Dexter, Dr. King’s church. And we’re in there, and we wake up - sleep
    anywhere, on the floor, on the pews. The water - the toilets won’t flush. It’s colder in there than it was outside;
    they’d cut the heat off. You know, the lights wouldn’t cut on. It was awful. Then we decided, “Well, we’re going to
    take over this.”

JM: And you have to tell me, have to tell the tape, how it was those things got cut off.

GP: The Deacons did it! The Deacons did it. I even - I won’t call names, uh, because they have, uh - what do you call, uh,
    gone through absolution?

JB: Redeemed themselves.

GP: Yeah, redeemed themselves. So, it’s no need in calling names. But I was furious! So, instead of leaving the church,
    we’re going to stay there, because the cops were outside the church. And that’s when Alabama State students came and
    served as a buffer. Uh, but we still - after we came outside, we still held the church, because we had big meetings down
    there. And there was this big meeting discussion between George Ware and Forman. And George had - he was older, he was a
    grad student. And George, I think, was looking out for the protection of the students, so he got into a whole, uh, state of
    mind as an adult. And Forman had manipulated us children, and here we are, you know, stuck, can’t get back to Tuskegee.
    It’s cold. They’re in jail. So, George became protective, paternalistic, as an adult over these little undergrads, and
    Forman was a manipulator.Well, I didn’t see it that way at all! So, I took issue with George Ware. You know, I said,
    “No, we’re grown. We knew precisely what we were doing. We knew the risks.” You know. And I think that was part of how
    I got elected student body president. You know, “How dare you be condescending? We’re not sheep. We’re scholars. And
    this is what we wanted to do. Nobody was killed.” So, that was a turning point. And we call that the march that wouldn’t
    turn around.And some kids have researched the archives and my papers and have won state history awards. One kid in
    particular in New Mexico, his mama - his grandmother lives here, and he’s a military kid and he knew of Tuskegee. Because,
    see, we had organized the ROTC, and during my administration, they were my personal bodyguards, okay? You know, and where
    was the munitions shack - oh, yeah, we knew all of that. Bettina didn’t even know where I was coming from, or where
    Tuskegee kids were coming from. And, uh, so this young kid - and I read his paper at the state archives as a presentation -
    uh, his father knew a Tuskegee grad, ROTC grad, and he told him about the march that wouldn’t turn around. I’d never
    used that name. That name came from this youngster.

JM: So, that’s where that came from. Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask about your - well, actually, John, let’s pause for a minute [and
    switch tracks].[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: Okay, we’re rolling again.

JM: Took a short break.

GP: Okay. Uh, the march that wouldn’t turn around - because we had said it was to be a march, and Tuskegee students, led by
    Sammy Young, who was one of the great organizers, but it was a whole committee, uh, buses and cars, to be true to what we
    had said, it was a relay march. People in cars would get out, like in the middle of the caravan, would get out and walk, and
    then the cars behind would come up, pick them up, students would get out. So, we literally held to our word that it was a
    march. And then this youngster, uh, dubbed it or entitled it “the march that wouldn’t turn around.”

JM: Nice. Okay, let’s take a short break. 

GP: Okey, dokey.[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: We’re cooking.

JM: Okay, we’re back after a break, about five or ten minutes, and we’ll do a last segment here to finish up. Dr. Patton,
    thanks so much for your patience in hanging in there with us. It’s a - I know it’s a lot of hard work in your chair. Uh,
    let me have you, if you would -

GP: That’s my postman.

JM: I’m sorry? Oh, that was - I think the mail carrier just came to the front door. That was the noise we heard. Um, if you
    could talk a little bit about, um - think about the period from spring ’65 forward, especially into ’66, I guess, the
    changes that, um, will quickly kind of, um, reshape, uh, SNCC, um, and how you continued to push your thinking about the
    question of social change, race, in the United States.

GP: Oh, that’s a tall order.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Uh, I’ll try to be brief. If you look at Eyes on the Prize, and it recaptures the Selma to Montgomery March, you will see
    in Lowndes County, which was the greatest - the longest stretch and has been the most overlooked; it’s Selma to
    Montgomery, when it ought to read Selma to Lowndes to Montgomery. And I’ve always resonated with the grassroots people.
    And as you look at that, you see a lot of people on the side. Those were Lowndes County people and some SNCC people.I was on
    the march initially. Uh, being an organizer, and perhaps a tacticianer, my greatest concern was how were the people going to
    eat, how were they going to go to the bathroom. So, my little brain told me, “Well, Tuskegee feeds twenty-three hundred
    students every day. Surely they ought to be able to prepare meals for the marchers.” And so, I went and talked to Dr.
    Foster about that, the president, and though we could not budget much money - and I had been on the march and saw the food,
    stayed overnight one night in one of the campsites. Len Chandler was there. I remember him so well. And I said, “I can’t
    take this food anymore.”So, I guess my sensibilities of how I was raised as a black middle, solid middle class, and in the
    black caste, probably upper middle class, so my sensibilities - and I’ve always - and I was taught not to make
    distinctions among people. People, uh, are a product of their circumstances. And that’s a whole other philosophical, uh,
    influence that my father, as well as my extended family, uh, instilled in me: not to make a difference. But I was tired of
    that food, and Tuskegee did provide a meal - I’ll never forget it - of barbequed chicken. I was so pleased at Dr. Foster,
    because I began to really feel now that he really understood the depth of what we were trying to do, and it was really a
    positive reflection of how we had been taught, uh, what our purpose was, our mission, uh, the Christian ethic to care for
    the least of these, Matthew 25. So, anyway, I just had to bring that in, because that’s still very poignant in my mind.
    And we didn’t eat the stewed, like, the boil-up food that I had seen in the sanatorium.So, the march is over. Lowndes
    County has a rich, rich movement history, from slavery times to Reconstruction all the way up. They were proud people, still
    are. And I thought they were being cheapened, uh, not fully understood and not respected for their deep, deep wisdom. So,
    we’re having these great discussions, uh, with TIAL at Tuskegee and SNCC people and Jim Forman in particular. We finally
    had come to the, to the, to the, to the, I don’t - it’s not a conclusion, but to the point that there is a fundamental
    distinction between integration and desegregation. And then, desegregation led to self-determination. Uh, we were there, and
    the Lowndes County people - we got the Voting Rights Act, right? We got the power of the vote. Now, what do we do with this
    vote? And the Lowndes County people made it very clear. John Hulett, [pause] oh, bless her heart, as much as I loved her,
    loved her, stayed in her home, she ran for school board, she was a schoolteacher - it’ll come to me. I have it in the
    archives back there. They said they didn’t want to be mayor or run for even city council, because we didn’t even know
    what a city was. We didn’t deal with city government; we dealt with county government.

JM: Yeah.

GP: They weren’t interested in being state representatives. They were interested in being - holding those positions which were
    the closest to the people, foremost being the High Sheriff, you know, who would just come - unclothed, unrobed Kluxers -
    raiding and terrorizing the black community. They wanted the board of education so that their children could have a decent
    quality education, which had nothing to do with Bunsen burners, even though we needed them, but quality teaching. Uh, they
    wanted to be tax assessors, because those black farmers who did have land were always assessed tremendously, while the white
    heirs of the white plantations were almost tax-nil. And then, the collectors, the coroner, where black people would be found
    dead in jail -

JM: Yeah.

GP: Or on the roadside or in ditches, and the coroner would come and say it was suicide or self-inflicted. So, that made a lot
    of us think again about what is the significance of the vote. And that was to elect people closest to the people. They
    wanted their own political party. There were efforts by Robert Kennedy, Attorney General at the time, to have the new black
    vote voted into the Democratic Party. And again, they dealt on a national level, on a - what we’d call a, you know,
    far-fetched. Our vicinity, our emphasis: the people who are closest to the people. We weren’t interested - we didn’t
    even know what a damned delegate was.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Now, of course, we knew about the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

JM: Exactly.

GP: Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer. And we made it very clear to SNCC that we were not going to replicate that model.

JM: Yeah. So, Lowndes County gets its, builds its own party.

GP: We looked at it. It wasn’t in competition. We just felt going to Atlantic City, some far distant place, might as well go
    to Mars, from our -

JM: Um-hmm, um-hmm.

GP: Range of experiences. We weren’t interested in electing delegates. We were interested in electing the sheriff.

JM: I have to ask: In that next election, then, you think the election is stolen. Can you talk a little bit about that?

GP: Yeah, I wrote about that.

JM: Yeah.

GP: It was stolen.

JM: Yeah. Can you describe that? 

GP: Yeah, I was there. [Sighs] There were still black people in Lowndes County. We were naïve. We thought the vote was some
    modicum of freedom, and that we could vote, be a free voter. But we saw the white terror surface with vehemence. People who
    were tenant farmers, who had to have a relationship with the owners of the plantation - we still called it a plantation -
    uh, were in a very dangerous position. And the landowner, the white plantation man, would bring the field hands, these
    tenant farmers, to the polls. Tell them - the reprisals were just enormous.

JM: Yeah.

GP: Uh, and to people who had nothing, the reprisal was death, because they couldn’t take anything - we didn’t have
    anything, so what could they take but our lives? But the people persevered. They voted. Uh, I wrote a piece called “No
    Clouds in the Sky,” uh, where the plantation owner, uh, property owner, white property owners, voted for everybody who
    worked on his property, in his fields. Uh, that was a lot. There was, uh, gun violence. Uh, I just have to give you my
    paper, which also has -

JM: Sure, sure.

GP: The voting tally.

JM: I’d love to see it. You did in that same - that was the November ’65 election - you did -

GP: This was November ’66. See, the Voting Acts Right was passed in August.

JM: Sure, [clears throat] ’66, excuse me.

GP: Yeah. We began to organize in Lowndes County.

JM: Yeah. Forgive me. I misspoke. You’re exactly right.

GP: Okay, okay.

JM: In ’66, um, you do, however, in part because of all the work that’s been done, um, in Macon County, you do elect a black
    sheriff in Macon County.

GP: Oh, yes!

JM: Which is a - 

GP: At the consternation of the black middle class bourgeoisie! He was dark-skinned in hue. Lucius Amerson - there’s a book
    written by his son. Uh, I think I have the book back here for you to take notes, so you can follow up on it. Uh, yes!

JM: Let me ask a final - let me ask a final question. I know we’re really kept you a long time. I want to ask one key final
    question. The, um, the car accident in ’67 is very unusual. The circumstances are very unusual.

GP: Still don’t know. I can’t even get a police report.

JM: Yeah. Just - if you would, just describe the basics of that, of that episode.

GP: Well, it was the eve of the first Black Power conference, which was underwritten by SHARP, with SNCC people being the
    facilitators.

JM: This is going to happen at Tuskegee.

GP: At Tuskegee. Uh, you have to read Forman’s book, because it didn’t take place on Tuskegee campus. It was supposed to,
    and I had organized that, and was at part of where we were to meet in the rooms, uh, the night before. And, uh, Dr. Foster
    somehow cancelled that. But Dean Phillips, dean of students, whom we had cultivated, was a part of us now, you know, he was,
    you know, supportive for what we were doing, and so he arranged something at the Boy Scouts camp or somewhere. Meanwhile,
    I’m in this car accident. I’m taking a young man to my grandmother’s home, my Mommy, to layover because I had arranged
    for him to fly to Canada to avoid the draft.

JM: This is part of your anti-draft work that’s begun, yeah.

GP: Um-hmm. And we’re in this mysterious car accident. We don’t hit anything; nothing hits us. [Sound of siren begins in
    background and continues] I don’t know what the - I don’t know how it happened. And it happened, and evidently I blacked
    out because I don’t remember anything until I woke up at John Andrews Hospital on the campus.

JM: Yeah. 

GP: And Forman, all of the SNCC people were there, and Tuskegee - we’ve got a new crop of Tuskegee people now. I had
    graduated, and they elected me, by the way - I was in graduate school at Tuskegee the summer of ’66 before I went to SHARP
    as vice-president. They wanted to reelect me as president, but I had graduated, and there was something about, um, the
    student body president had to be a senior. But, again, George Ware - SHARP, with the legalese, said nothing about the
    qualifications of the vice-president. So, I ran as vice-president and won. And my main thing then was that we’ve got to
    line up presidents for the next four years, which we did: Warren Hamilton and Benny James and, you know, and all, you know,
    to keep this movement thing alive. That’s how I think; I think like that.

JM: Um-hmm.

GP: And, uh, so that night, February the tenth, 1967, I’ll never forget it, uh, I’m in this tremendous car accident, I’m
    in John Andrews Hospital, so I’m at another, uh - what do you call it - obstacle in my life. And I have to have blood
    transfusions, and SNCC people and students - that’s when I wrote the piece on Booker T. Washington.

JM: Yeah, yeah. About the accident, [clears throat] your sense - it was such an odd thing. A part of your car failed, didn’t
    it?

GP: Yeah, the whole - what do you call it - axle rod broke in half.

JM: Yeah, yeah. So, you wonder if someone tampered with your car, yeah.

GP: I try not to even think about it.

JM: Right, right.

GP: But it has to be. I mean, how can an axle rod - isn’t that the, kind of like the skeleton - how does it crack in half?

JM: Yeah, yeah.

GP: Uh, but what’s significant about that, and then we’re going to conclude, is that I’m in the hospital. Dr. [John] Hume,
    who’s a bourgie doctor, who never supported movement activities, really thought we were destroying the, what they thought
    the model city - that was the little thing they - that’s why we tried to integrate churches. , “Are you crazy? These
    white folks don’t like you.” Okay, and that’s another whole story.

JM: [Coughs] We won’t, yeah, we - 

GP: And, uh, so Dr. Hume, who hated us, the Movement, me in particular, uh, student body president, wanted to cut my leg off,
    amputate.

JM: Yeah.

GP: I said, “Oh, no, no, no, no.” And what kicked in, to be honest, was Freud, my whole thought process. I’m twenty-two
    years old, I think, and my thing was, “What if a man and I are intimate, you know, and some kind of - what do you call -
    pre-, you know, and we had kind of taken off our clothes sexily, and then I say, ‘Oh, wait a minute! I’ve got to take
    off my leg.” That was my motivation.

JM: Hmm, yeah.

GP: I’m telling you, that’s honest.

JM: Yeah. Yeah, that’s a young person’s normal reaction, I think.

GP: And so, I called my paternal grandparents. No, I asked Dr. Hume - to show you another stream of thought that shaped my
    consciousness - I said, “Have you talked to another doctor about this? You know, have you had a second opinion?” And he
    was, uh, caustic and he says [speaking loudly], “That’s what’s wrong with you! You think you know everything!” And
    then, I leaned over. I said, “Well, have you talked with the Lord about it?”

JM: With the Lord?

GP: Um-hmm.

JM: Yeah.

GP: He said [speaking loudly], “Well, what does God have to do with it?” So, I leaned back. I said, “Put the piece of
    paper on the nightstand.” I called my grandparents, my paternal grandparents. My granddaddy is straight as an arrow,
    Deacon, Trustee Emeritus, never smoked, never drank, Sunday School Superintendent for life, you know, read the Bible, taught
    me the Bible, you know, and all of the, the, uh, you know, the precepts and all of that.And I told them, I said, “my dear,
    this man said that he didn’t need to talk to the Lord about my foot. Come and get me!” My grandmother and granddaddy
    dispatched my cousin; they came and got me, because this man was a heathen! And that’s how [laughs] I got out of the
    hospital. I think if I had never said that, then they would have sided with the doctor, because he knows best. My little
    brain just always - but when he couldn’t understand that the Lord had everything to do with it? And then, when I got back
    home, I went to stay with my - Mommy, my maternal grandmother, because I just found so much comfort with her, that’s when
    I called Bettina Aptheker, put all of my ducks in a row.

JM: That began your transition to New York?

GP: I told Bettina, “I’ve got to find me a doctor.”

JM: Yeah.

GP: “What about the Medical Committee for Human Rights?”

JM: Yeah. Yeah, Medical Com - yeah. Let’s use -

GP: And that’s how I got to New York.

JM: Let’s use that point as our stopping point today. Um, you’ve been so generous, and it’s just such an honor and
    privilege to be with you. Thank you so much, Dr. Patton.

GP: But let me, because - thank you so much, but I want to be fair to SNCC. And so, it’s when I’m in New York, it’s the
    SNCC people, and particularly Jim Forman, the CORE people, who had a relationship with SNCC people, and then I also - my
    fiancé was in New York, who really came to support me. Uh, Richard Wright’s daughter - I became a cause célèbre - Julia
    Wright, Richard Wright’s daughter, would come and see me when she came from Paris. And all - Bettina Aptheker, the
    Communist Party, the Social Workers Party, the Progressive Labor Party, and I was introduced to all of these new people, uh,
    Mary Kochiyama - I had never seen a Japanese person in my life, you know. Hispanic - I shouldn’t say that - Latinas and
    Latinos, Puerto Ricans - I never saw a Spanish person in my life. So, my world was just really even - open even more. And
    so, when I got out of the hospital, or on those, uh, furloughs from the hospital, because I would be in there for six months
    at a time - organized a union, [Local] 1199, played poker and won all the money, because I’m a good poker player, and all
    of that - that when I got out, that’s when I said, “I will work for SNCC.”

JM: Yeah.

GP: And I did.

JM: Yeah. Thank you so much. What a wonderful visit. Thank you.

GP: Thank you.

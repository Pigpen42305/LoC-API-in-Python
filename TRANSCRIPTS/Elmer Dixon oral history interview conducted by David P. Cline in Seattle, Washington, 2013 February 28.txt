JB: First, let me say that you’re on Channel 2.

DC: Okay.

JB: Mr. Dixon is on Channel 1.

DC: Okay. So, this is David Cline. I’m on Channel 2. I’m going to be talking today with Mr. Elmer Dixon, who is on Channel
    1. We are in Seattle, Washington. Today’s date is February the 28th, 2013. Again, this is David Cline for the Smithsonian
    and Mr. Elmer Dixon.

JB: Okay. So, we’re rolling. 

DC: Okay! So, I wanted to thank you very much, again, for meeting with me today—Elmer Dixon: A pleasure and an honor.

DC: To tell your story. And what I’d like to do is start by just having you talk a little bit about the family that you were
    raised in, where they came, how you ended up here in Seattle, and what kind of home and values you feel that you were raised
    with.

ED: Okay. Yeah, my—both parents were originally from [clears throat] Chicago. Actually, my father was from Kentucky, born in
    Kentucky, but moved to Chicago at a young age and was raised there. And my mother was raised in Chicago as well, but her
    parents had come up through the great southern migration from the South, [clears throat] from Mississippi. And so, both of
    them had—well, my mother clearly—southern roots. My grandmother used to say that Kentucky’s not the South; it’s a
    border state. [Laughs] But, as we know, it’s got some southern aspects to it.But so, I was born in Chicago and spent my
    early years between Chicago and Champaign, Illinois, where my father worked at an Air Force base. He actually was a World
    War II vet, but he was an illustrator who graduated from the Chicago Art Institute and [clears throat] so he worked on
    illustrating engineers’ designs for aircraft or aircraft parts.And [clears throat] he eventually decided to move away from
    Illinois. I think he loved Chicago and the Chicago area, but he was an adventuresome sort. And, part of that story is, of
    course, he wanted to get as far as he could [laughs] away from his mother-in-law, but [laughter]. But so, he got an
    opportunity to work at Boeing—and this would have been in 1957—and as an illustrator. And, of course back then, you
    know, there were no computer enhancements or computer drawings. Everything was done by hand. And that’s what brought us to
    the Northwest.One of the things that I reflect on when I tell my story and my transition—I did a presentation in Lille,
    France, in 2010, and it was at a conference with an organization called the Society for Intercultural Education, Training
    and Research. And for the last twenty-six-plus years, I’ve been doing work in the field of diversity and cross-cultural
    communication. And [clears throat] during that span of time—and I’ll come back around to this—during that span of
    time, we have a lot of corporate clients, and so [laughs] my identity as a Panther never was talked about or spoken about.
    Only people in the Northwest who were clients, who knew of my past, knew that I was connected to the Black Panther Party.
    But my corporate clients—and I’ve sat in offices with the CEO of PepsiCo and other major companies around the United
    States, and no one ever knew. But here was an opportunity at this particular—they call it a congress that SIETAR Europa
    holds every three to four years. At this particular SIETAR conference in France, the theme of their conference was “Human
    Rights and Cultural Diversity: Where Do You Draw the Line?” And I saw that as a perfect opportunity to talk about that
    topic because of my own experiences as a member of the Black Panther Party and also as an interculturalist through the work
    that I do. And so, in fact, my speech was titled “From Revolutionary to Interculturalist.”But I think that’s a kind of
    an interesting concept, as I’ve thought about it, because I actually probably began my early life in some ways as an
    interculturalist and never knew it, never realized it at the time. And that was because of the values that our parents
    instilled in us, but also the environment that we grew up in. In Chicago, we lived on the South Side. I stayed with my
    grandmother on my mother’s side of the family for a couple of years as a young toddler. But on the South Side of Chicago,
    then as today, it’s largely a segregated community, largely black. [Clears throat] And in Champaign, while I don’t
    remember much about the neighborhood in Champaign—I know we were in a housing project there—I don’t remember too many
    different-color friends at that young age. I don’t know if I would have noticed, but I knew that—looking back, I know
    that Chicago on the South Side, it was a predominately—it was a black community.When we moved to Seattle, and it took us a
    couple of years to settle in the home that my mother still lives in, Madrona. We moved in that home in 1960. And, as a
    ten-year-old, moving into this neighborhood in Madrona, it was like landing in the proverbial melting pot, if you will. I
    don’t like to refer to the U.S. as a melting pot—more like a salad bowl rather than a melting pot—but that was the
    neighborhood in which we landed in. And it was a neighborhood that had been, maybe thirty-forty years earlier, a
    predominately white neighborhood, a Jewish neighborhood. There were synagogues in the area. And what happened, as has
    happened in most inner cities, as blacks moved in, whites would move out. And in this particular neighborhood, a little bit
    of everyone moved in.

DC: Yeah.

ED: And so, on the playground, which is across the street from our home that we grew up in, it was the gathering place. And
    [clears throat] I’ll tell you, you could go onto that playground and interact with white kids, who were average income,
    rich kids, rich white kids who lived across the red zone line, which happened to be two blocks from our home.

DC: Um-hmm.

ED: We didn’t know it at the time, the red-lining district. And there was Chinese, there were Japanese, there were Filipino,
    there were Latino, Mexican-American. It was just everybody was there, and black, of course. 

DC: Right.

ED: And while it was, I think, largely black, it had—you know, percentage wise—but everybody else was there, as well. And
    so, that was the environment in which we grew up in and at the schools that we attended.But the other side of that was the
    influences that our parents had on us. And while they had grown up or gone through life, their adult life and early life,
    with some consciousness of what was going on in America—I don’t know how you could be unconscious to it in the ’40s,
    ’50s, [pause] ’60s. My father, when he was—I think he was in high school at the time, or had just graduated when Pearl
    Harbor was bombed. And he and his buddies, who had formed a—and they may have been in their first year of college—had
    formed a group called the Four Feathers that was named after the Four Feathers at Notre Dame.

DC: Um-hmm.

ED: And they actually had sweaters, which my mom still has the sweater today, with the feather on it and the number four on it.
    And they were a tight-knit group. They all went out and they volunteered for the draft because they wanted to fight and
    defend their country. And when they were able to—

DC: And these are four black men?

ED: These are four black men.

DC: Yeah.

ED: And they were able to get through the induction process and they were assigned their orders to go to boot camp. It had some
    city on there that they didn’t know where it was, and I think it said “MS” at the end, and they were thinking they
    were going to Massachusetts or someplace. [Laughter] Well, as it turned out, they were going to Mississippi. And [clears
    throat], so when they got down there, of course, in segregated living quarters, you know, segregated camp, if you will, they
    would drill and go through the regular rigors of boot camp in preparation for, you know, preparing to fight at some point.
    And [clears throat] on probably more than one occasion, as my father recounted these stories—if you kind of remember any
    of the old movies where soldiers are marching off to fight in this big war they called World War II, the Big One, and the
    confetti would be flying and people would be standing on the side of the street, waving flags and cheering them on, you
    know, as they got ready to go out and defend America. And so, when they walked through this Mississippi town, they weren’t
    greeted by confetti and flags. They were greeted by crowds that were booing and hissing at them, and spitting and throwing
    things and calling them “nigger.” And it was a—while I’m sure my father wasn’t oblivious to this, but it was kind
    of a rude awakening: you know, in 1942 or ’43, whenever that was that they were getting ready to go put their lives on the
    line to defend America, they had this strong sense of pride and patriotism to go defend the United States after the attack
    on Pearl Harbor, and to be treated like that.But those and other incidents that occurred—you know, my mother had her fair
    share of incidents about her color—but they never, those things never colored their perception of other people. It never
    left them with a negative sense of who other people were or are. And so, we always learned to, as Dr. King used to say,
    “Judge people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin,” and I think that was one of the
    principal values that we grew up with that was so strong in our household.[Clears throat] And so, I remember during those
    early years and as we were developing and living in this environment that my father had a fierce protective sense about his
    family and about his kids. And I remember on one occasion—I had two very close friends out of all of these people, kids
    that I met. I tended to be kind of an outgoing kid. And on our block there was a black family that was large that was at the
    end of our street, and there was a white family next-door to them. In fact, everybody in the neighborhood called the woman
    “Auntie Barbara.” So, she was like [laughs], you know, the auntie—you know, you always hear about the auntie—and she
    was a white woman. And then, her son—actually, I think it was maybe either her grandson or stepson—was a good friend of
    ours.But my two best friends were two young white guys who I had met through school, and we used to hang out a lot. But we
    always used to get in our mischief, as well. And I remember we used to go and get eggs from the local store and go throw
    them at passing cars. And one evening, we were out tossing eggs, and Aaron, my brother Aaron, was with us at the time. And
    everybody had tossed the eggs and took off. And we missed the car. And so, I wasn’t leaving. I was determined to land my
    egg. And a car came through—I didn’t notice it was the same car that had barely gotten missed before—and I launched my
    egg. And as it hit, the car stopped, the guy got out and ran up and grabbed me. And I don’t think he meant any real ill. I
    think he was trying to scold me and tell me that was not right or whatever. But here I was, eleven or twelve years old, and
    I was, you know, like petrified and mad and struggling and got away. And ran—it was more than a block from our home—and
    ran to the house and burst through the door and told my father this man was attacking me. And he grabbed the nearest thing
    he could grab, a hammer or whatever, and went right out the door, you know, because no one was going to attack his kid. But
    that was, you know, that fierce protection of your family was one thing that we learned.And so, on any given weekend,
    [clears throat] my parents would have guests over. And on one weekend, they might have one of their black friends over, a
    black couple, and they would sit down and listen to Ellington and, you know, Count Basie. We grew up with a lot of music in
    our house. And then, on other occasions, there would be different people that would come over.And I remember on Saturday
    mornings, many times, that we would get up, and it was “wax-the-floor” days. And my mother still lives in this big
    house. It’s a big, huge, four-bedroom house built around the turn of the twentieth century, like in 1908. It’s a very
    sturdy big home. And we would have to roll back the—push back the furniture, roll up the carpets, and on our hands and
    knees—the boys.

DC: Um-hmm.

ED: Not my sister. She got to—she got off of that duty [laughter]. We had to get on—

DC: How many are there in your family?

ED: There’s four of us.

DC: Okay.

ED: And she’s the oldest, and then the three boys, and I’m the middle son. And so, we [clears throat] had to get on our
    hands and knees and wax these floors, these hardwood floors, to a high luster. And while we were doing so, my father would
    have playing on the hi-fi La Bohème, Madame Butterfly, The Tales of Hoffmann, so we learned an appreciation for opera at a
    very young age. And so, we had a full range of appreciation of different kinds of music. That was, again, that kind of
    broad, kind of cultural overlay.But we found out later [clears throat] why we had to polish the floors: because on certain
    nights of the month, he would invite his Scandinavian friends over. And they were from various parts of Scandinavia and
    lived in various parts of the city, but they were all white. A couple of them were Jewish. And they would come in and they
    would do these loud Scandinavian dances, [laughter] dancing on the floor. You could hear the wooden floors just rocking with
    this, with these dances, these Scandinavian dances. And so, when I think about [clears throat] the cross-cultural
    experiences that we had as kids—we would go over to some of the Jewish friends’ homes on Easter, actually on their
    Passover, and I ate my first matzo ball when I was probably eleven years old and gained [laughing] a high appreciation and
    liking for Jewish culture, and especially the eating of the festive food that they ate. And they would come over and, you
    know, maybe share an Easter dinner with us. There was almost like a cultural exchange that was going on there. [Phone
    ringing in background]And on other occasions, of the two white friends that I mentioned, one was—his mother was a second
    generation—I believe she was second generation Russian. I know her mother was first generation, his grandmother. And so,
    we would go over there—I would go over to their house on Christmas celebrations. And they were Orthodox Christians and
    they ate certain kinds of foods that were very unique to that Russian culture. And so, it was a pretty interesting
    experience growing up in that neighborhood, in terms of the exposure to the different types of cultures and individuals that
    were in that neighborhood.There was a popular grocery store, a small little store around the corner from us, called Joe’s
    Supermarket. And Joe and his wife, Mae, were Chinese immigrants, and they were very well-known in the community. And I
    remember once after one of my friends taught me how to steal candy bars, I was nervous as heck, you know. You were asking me
    whether or not I would get nervous. I don’t get nervous talking, but I remember when I was trying to steal this one candy
    bar, I was probably so nervous, you know, because it was outside of my, you know, [laughter] what I believed one should do.
    But he said, “Nah, you can do it! Get it!” And Mae caught me, and for the next, I think, twenty years, she called me
    “Bad Boy.” [Laughter] But she would joke about it in later years.But it was—[clears throat] it was a close
    relationship that everyone had in that neighborhood. And, as I said, we came from so many different cultural backgrounds, it
    was an important development in our lives and eventually in mine, in terms of this full circle, in terms of the work that I
    do today.

DC: And I imagine your—just a quick pause? Yeah.[Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: Now we’re going again.

DC: Okay. I was going to ask—for your father at Boeing, which I imagine wasn’t a largely African American workforce, I mean,
    I imagine he had to navigate that world as well. 

ED: You know, I—[clears throat] I’m not sure how much he had to navigate. I’m sure he did have to navigate, but he
    was—you know, when you talk about influences, there are several things that I pulled from my experience growing up with my
    parents. And one of the things that I, two of the things that I got from my father, was his outgoingness. Everybody loved
    him, and he could make friends like in a minute. You know, he was very—I guess charismatic is one way to put it. But he
    was [laughs], he was very smooth; he was easy to get along with.And so, he made friends very quickly at Boeing. In fact,
    many of those people—I suppose that he met many of them at Boeing. I’m sure all of them did not work at Boeing. He had
    to meet them in some other connection, you know. I know that he had some connection with some of the civil rights
    organizations, as well as I think even there may have been, you know, kind of the taboo back then, the Communist Party
    members. I don’t know to what degree he interacted with those folks, but all of those people that I mentioned who I’ve
    known through adulthood have all had very progressive positions about things in society. And so, there had to be some
    connection, and some of them, in fact, were part of like the Socialist Workers Party, or whatever.So, he was a very outgoing
    person, and that was one of the things that I absorbed from his personality. The other thing was the adventurism. He was
    always looking to find some adventure in life. I remember there was a program on TV back when we were growing up called
    “Adventures in Paradise,” and this ship called the Kon-Tiki would sail around the world and stop in exotic places. And
    he had been stationed in Hawaii during his tour. He ended up in Okinawa, in that part of the world, during the war and had
    always wanted to go back to Hawaii someday. And he used to tell us that he was going to, you know, sell the house, quit his
    job, and get a big boat and sail us around the world—

DC: Right.

ED: You know, on these adventures. So, he was a big dreamer in that way. And that was the other thing that I took from him. And
    I think what it resulted in for me, personally, was a kind of a can-do attitude, which would come into play initially when I
    got into the Black Panther Party and later in life as I embarked on my own personal life. Because, as a member of the Black
    Panther Party, we were all-in for the community and we didn’t have any selfish desires or individual desires at that point
    of our life. But anyway, so that was kind of the [coughs] the foundation of my growing up. We also—we marched with King
    when he came here in ’65, so my father and mother were very much aware of the surroundings. And, you know, the kind of
    awareness-building for me, or the political awareness that I came to, was—it was rather quite sudden, but it wasn’t like
    I wasn’t aware of things that were happening along the way. I remember significant events, very significant events, in
    history and ultimately their impact on me. I remember, obviously, Kennedy being elected. But I remember him being
    assassinated in ’63, and sitting in front of the TV and kind of mimicking the soldiers as they were marching along with
    his coffin, and seeing Ruby assassinated on live TV—not Ruby, but Oswald being assassinated on live TV. I remember Medgar
    Evers being shot. I remember the bombing of the Baptist church and the three little girls and seeing their bloodstained
    clothes.On nightly TV, you know, it seemed like—we had a routine, of course, as I think many families did then and maybe
    today still, where when we got home, you know, we had to finish our homework before we could go out to the park or go do
    something. Homework was done, dinner was on the table at six o’clock, and we had to be there at the table. It was
    important to my father that we eat around the table together as a family; we did that every night. And then, after dinner
    was over, wash the dishes, put them away, because everybody had a routine. [Laughs] In fact, I used that same routine when I
    was raising my family: Someone washed, someone dried, and someone put them away. And so, after that was done, then there was
    time to watch TV.And then, of course, I remember on the nightly evening news spots seeing the, you know, incidents like the
    Bloody Sunday on the Pettus Bridge, and demonstrators being beaten by police and hosed by firefighters and bitten by police
    dogs. You know, those were very vivid scenes. And I think it was painful for me, in that I was a young boy growing up who,
    while I had aspirations of being a doctor—you know, I think that a lot of kids relate to people that kind of protect the
    community.

DC: Um-hmm.

ED: So, being a police officer or a firefighter was a position that you looked at with respect. And seeing that dichotomy with
    these protectors of society being brutal and being the opposite of what you would expect was an interesting way to view how
    things were shaking out in our real world. And I didn’t realize it at the time, but those things would become part of my
    psyche and part of my growth and development. One of my colleagues that I work with today he talks about the effects of
    racism, and he says that it’s not a single incident. You know, sometimes people ask you, “So, when have you been
    discriminated against?” Or, “What has happened to you?” And it’s not a single incident. He calls it a series of
    micro abrasions. You know, it’s like when you have a wound or a sore, and it scabs over, and you keep picking at the scab
    because it’s bothering you, that over time it’s like this wound that never goes away. And he compares the experience, in
    its whole, of racism and oppression and all of the things that have occurred, not only to blacks, but to other people that
    have been oppressed, as this series of micro abrasions.So, as I saw these things, they were having some impact, but I
    didn’t realize just how so. And it was in the summer of, I believe, 1967—it was either ’67 or ’66—

DC: And what year were you born?

ED: I was born in 1950.

DC: That’s right.

ED: So, I was a sixteen-year-old or a seventeen-year-old at the time. My brother, Aaron, being a year older than me, was a
    little—his awareness point [coughs] actually happened before mine. And [drinks water] we would talk about these [coughs]
    occurrences [clears throat], but I wasn’t fully into this awareness piece yet.It was also an interesting time, because in
    the mid ’60s the black awareness movement was happening, and it hadn’t hit me yet. I don’t think it had hit our city
    yet. In ’65 I was still skateboarding with my two very close white friends. You know, we would go up to Crater Lake, which
    is the second-deepest lake in the world, and we went up there with his parents, his mother and siblings, and we got on our
    skateboards and skateboarded down. That was in ’65. So, you know, I was a fifteen-year-old at the time and so I hadn’t
    gotten into awareness of who I was as, you know, as a black person.And my brother—it was, like I said, either ’66 or
    ’67—invited or told me that I needed to go hear this speaker that was coming to Garfield High School, and the
    speaker’s name was Stokely Carmichael. And I didn’t know much about Stokely. I had heard a little bit. Aaron and I had
    talked a little bit. But I did know that—you know, I was aware of the Watts Rebellions and the Detroit Rebellions. It’s
    an interesting thing, you know. Of course, people refer to them as riots, the Watts Riots and the Detroit Riots. There was a
    well-known musician and writer who wrote several high-profile R&amp;B songs that were successful in the charts, and the
    writer, the songwriter, was white. And after the Watts and Detroit rebellions, he wrote an essay in which he said that the
    rebellions in Detroit and Watts were a natural response to the conditions in which those people lived. And because of that,
    he was blacklisted. He didn’t get any record contracts for another ten to fifteen years. And so, I was aware of those
    things, but it hadn’t kind of meshed for me yet, all of those things that were occurring.And so, I went to hear Stokely
    and I remember vividly the things that Stokely was talking about, Stokely Carmichael was talking about. And one of the
    things I remember him saying was that the problem with the black community is that black people don’t love themselves. And
    he said, “You hate the color of your skin and you want to be white.” And he said, “Look at how you’ve been
    programmed. You know, when you go to a movie theater and you see the good knight and the bad knight, why is the good knight
    always on a white horse and the bad knight always on a black horse? When you turn on your TV and you look at a western, why
    is the good cowboy dressed in white, wears a ten-gallon hat and rides a horse named Trigger, a white horse named Trigger,
    and the bad cowboy is named Dirty Bart, and he’s in black clothes and on a black horse?” And he said, “Even when you
    go sit down and eat food, you order cake for dessert, and Angel’s Food cake is white and Devil’s Food cake is black.”
    And he made all these analogies, and I was thinking, “Ah, that has nothing to do with anything. I don’t hate the fact
    that I’m black.”And after I had left that rally, and I was sitting on the playground. I remember I was sitting on the
    tennis courts. And the tennis courts, the playground and the tennis courts are right across the street from our house, so
    during the summer months, that’s when we—when our parents were at work, we would go to the playground and either play or
    play in the community center or play tennis. And I was—I began to think about these, you know, what he had said and think
    about some of the occurrences in my own life.And I remember thinking about our tennis team, because here we were, a tennis
    team that was predominately black. And an instructor who came to teach us the finer points of the game—her name was Miss
    Sullivan. She came as a—I don’t know if she was a volunteer or a worker who came through the Park Department. And she
    was a—I think she was either a student at the University of Washington or was recently graduated from there. But anyway,
    she taught us the finer points about tennis. And everybody loved Miss Sullivan; she was cute, too!And that year, [clears
    throat] we had won all of our tournaments and had won the right to go play for the city championship. And the city
    championship was being held not fifteen-twenty blocks from our house, across the red line, which we didn’t know existed,
    but down on the lake at the Seattle Tennis Club. And so, we got on our tennis whites and, you know, our little shirts that
    said Madrona on it, and she got us down to the Tennis Club, and we were sitting in the cafeteria waiting for our turn to go
    out on the tennis court. And in walked this tall black man in kitchen whites, and he looked at us black kids sitting there
    and he said, “What are you doing in here? You better get back there and get your clothes on and get to work!” Well, he
    thought we were the help, some hired help for maybe an event that they were having. And as it turned out, of course,
    [laughs] they didn’t allow blacks in the Tennis Club. And, you know, we didn’t know that. [Clears throat] So, we told
    him, “We’re here to play tennis,” and he thought we were joking.We actually went out and beat the other team, which
    happened to be a white team. And the Tennis Club, along with like some Park Department officials—I can’t believe they
    were Park Department officials that would have done this; they had to have been officials at the Seattle Tennis Club—left
    before giving us our trophies. They didn’t have a trophy presentation. We were supposed to have a trophy presentation out
    on the court, and they left before and didn’t give us our trophies. And it was because we were in their all-white tennis
    club.And I remember thinking about that and thinking about, you know, a few other things that had occurred. My mother, when
    we moved here, and she had gone for an interview for a job she had found in the newspaper, and when she got there, they told
    her that the position was filled. And she said, “Well, I just saw it in the paper.” And they said, “But, yeah, we’ve
    filled it since then,” and she had called down to see if it was still open. And so, she went back, and I don’t know if
    she went to a phone booth or whatever, and she called them again. And said, “I’m inquiring about this position.” And
    they said, “Oh, sure! Come down and we’d like you to apply.”

DC: Right.

ED: I remembered hearing about, you know, hearing those things and observing these things. But all the while, you know, there
    were my friends who were white, the pastor at our church who was white. I had a good relationship with people. So, it
    wasn’t about black and white. And I thought to myself, “I don’t want to be white. I like who I am. But sometimes I
    maybe wish that I had [laughs] some of the things that they had.” You see, my two white friends who lived on the other
    side of the red line, they lived in—the neighborhood just two blocks away was upscale. One of them, in fact, even had a
    maid, and their maid’s name was Hazel. [Laughing] There used to be a 1960s TV show, “Hazel.”

DC: Yeah. [Laughter]

ED: You know, I wanted the things that they had, which were nicer than mine, but I didn’t want to be white, I don’t think.
    But that’s kind of where the awareness of my own skin color and the fact that I needed to be prideful in it began. And, as
    I—

DC: So, Stokely’s words kind of rattled around? 

ED: Stokely’s words rattled around. And so, my brother and I knew that we had to be involved. He had already become—this was
    now in the fall of ’67. He had started at the University of Washington and was in the Black Student Union with perhaps one
    of the other people you may be interviewing, Larry Gossett.And I was now a senior going into high school, and I had actually
    joined SNCC and was appointed the co-chair of the Seattle chapter of SNCC. And we would try to do some community organizing,
    but most of the organizing was around voter registration. That was one of the big things during the Civil Rights Movement
    was registering black people to vote because of the conditions in the South—you know, really kind of pushed this Civil
    Rights Movement across the United States, and so we did some of the same things that they were doing, and one was voter
    registration.But we felt like we didn’t have much direction, and we were contemplating, you know, how can we make an
    impact? And I was politicized by then. I was aware of who I was, and I was becoming politically aware and standing up. And,
    in fact, I, along with four or five of my closest friends at Garfield, decided that we were going to have a Black Student
    Union at Garfield. And we were met with all kinds of opposition.Of course, when we went to the principal with our idea, he
    said, “No, you can’t have a Black Student Union. You don’t need one. You have a Boys Club.” Of course, “Boys”
    was a derogatory term back then, which, in fact, to the credit of one of my—he’s deceased now—one of my classmates,
    who was student body president, got the name changed to the Garfield Men’s Club. But we said, “Yeah, but that’s for
    the whole student body. We need something to speak for the rights of black students.” And he said, “No, we’re not
    going to do that.”And [clears throat] so, we were adamant that we were going to have a Black Student Union. So, we did
    several kinds of things to agitate. I was in the—what they called the stage band and the jazz band. I had learned to play
    trumpet. All of us kids had picked up an instrument, but I probably was the—I was the one that stayed with mine the
    longest. I was in the marching band; I was the drum major of the band. I was in the concert band, both in junior high and in
    high school. And I was in, now, the elite band, which was the jazz band, and they called it the stage band because we got to
    play at the pep rallies.And so, one of the things that I, as I became politicized, when the Pledge of Allegiance was, you
    know, said every morning, I wouldn’t stand up for the Pledge of Allegiance. When we had to play at the pep rallies, to
    play the “Star-Spangled Banner” at the start of the pep rally, I would sit down and play the “Star-Spangled Banner.”
    I got kicked out of school on a couple of occasions because I wouldn’t adhere to the rules. And on one morning, we
    decided, “Well, we’re going to throw off this pep rally to gain recognition,” and we did this chant, where I would
    start, and then they would echo in the stands. And it went something like, “Bing, bing, bang, bang, ungawa, Black
    Power,” so people would echo what we said. And then, when we did that, the whole student body just erupted—everybody!
    Black students, white students, Asian—all of them—just erupted! And so, I got kicked out of school for that.But then, so
    we decided—we were kind of putting the pressure on—we decided, “Well, we’re going to call a boycott.” And we told
    the principal, “If you don’t give us a BSU, we’re going to boycott classes.” And he said, “Ah, yeah. Well, it’ll
    only be you and your friends, and then we’ll expel you again.” And so, what he didn’t realize was that for most of
    those white students, the Asian students, the Latino students, we’d all gone to school together from grade school on up,
    and these were—most of them were our friends. And so, when we—and plus, I was the drum major of the marching band.
    [Laughing] Everybody in school knew who I was.And so, when we called the boycott, the only people who went to class were the
    honor students, and the hallway in Garfield filled up in front of the principal’s office. No one was going to class. And
    the principal sent out his messenger, and they relented. We got a Black Student Union, and we were the first, actually the
    first high school Black Student Union on the West Coast.And so, I was becoming more now kind of aware of not only my own
    self and having developing a political consciousness, but there were a few incidents that were kind of projecting me into a
    leadership role. And there were a couple of minor scrapes. You know, I had never been arrested before. I remember coming
    back from a high school basketball game, at which I had played; I had my trumpet with me. And I went down to one of the
    local spots where teens gathered, which happened to be, in fact, in front of a rival high school, Franklin High School. And
    there was a—it was like a big riot going on. I had kind of landed in the middle of a riot.And I didn’t realize what was
    happening, but I got out anyway to see why, you know, police were throwing tear gas and dispersing kids. And there was this
    one black girl that I knew, Deborah Rodriguez, who was being pinned to the ground by two officers. And I was asking her,
    “Are you alright?” What’s—you know, “Get your knee off her back!” And the next thing I knew, I was being whisked
    away, handcuffed and taken off to juvenile, and I was charged with inciting a riot [laughs] because I was speaking out, you
    know, against this young black woman being brutalized by these cops.And when I went before the judge, you know, I wouldn’t
    relent. But what he said was, “I’m not going to sentence you to any time, but I’d like you to write an essay on why
    you thought it was important to defend that young woman.” And so, I did. Around this same time, there was a few incidents
    happening at that high school, Franklin High School. There had been a fight between four students. And Franklin was almost
    as—about as diverse as Garfield. And this fight between two white students had nothing to do with race. But the two white
    students were sent back to class, and the two black students were expelled. There was a young black woman who showed up one
    day with an Afro. And the principal—she was sent to the principal’s office and she was told to—she was expelled from
    school and told she could come back to school when she had an appropriate hairdo. And that was kind of the last straw.And
    the students at Franklin, the black students there, wanted to organize and wanted, one, to get this young woman reinstated
    in school, and they wanted a Black Student Union. And, of course, they had gotten the same answer that we had gotten. So,
    they called Larry, who was at the UW, and called me at Garfield. And so, several of us at Garfield and the UW, including my
    brother, Aaron, came to Franklin, met with the students, and then we walked across the street and walked into the
    principal’s office and took over the principal’s office and had a sit-in his office and told him we were taking over his
    office until they addressed these concerns and gave the students some representation through a Black Student Union.They fled
    the office, and we ended up staying in the building overnight. The next morning, the phone rang. And, you know, we were
    doing business. We answered the phone, “Good morning, Franklin High School.” You know? [Laughs] And it was the
    administration, and they said, “Look, you can have—we’ll address these demands. You’ll have—they’ll get a BSU.
    Please leave our building.” So, we left the building.And it was about a week later. I was in my geometry class at
    Garfield. And the phone rang, and Mr. Naramore said that someone in the office wants you in the office, which wasn’t
    unusual. I had been called to the office on a number of occasions. [Laughter] So, I stepped outside of the office, and in
    the hallway were two detectives, who read me my rights and handcuffed me and proceeded to escort me out of the school, and I
    was being arrested for unlawful assembly. And unbeknownst to me at the time, my brother Aaron, Larry Gossett, and several
    other leaders, both at the UW and at the two high schools, were being arrested almost simultaneously.And within the
    hour—it had to be within the hour or so—King was assassinated. And one, we knew that they had gotten us off of the
    street because they wanted to get leaders, potentially, that could cause, you know, some confusion for them off of the
    street. So, all of the leaders of the, you know, the radical leaders, they had gotten. The black radical leaders they had
    gotten and put us in jail. I was in juvenile because I was underage. And I remember being in juvenile and seeing—

DC: What did they charge you with?

ED: Unlawful assembly. 

DC: Okay. From the Franklin—?

ED: From the Franklin incident. And I remember seeing the cities burning across the U.S. And James Brown was in D.C., and they
    had been trying to do a concert, and he was trying to tell people, you know, “Don’t go out and burn your
    neighborhoods!” He was exhorting people not to riot and not to burn, but to no avail. People were mad.And my parents, when
    they came to pick me up that evening, that night, to get me out of juvenile, they had realized that both of their sons were
    in jail now, their two older sons. And when they picked me up, the only thing they said to me was, “Are you alright?”
    And then, we drove home in silence. And, you know, the feeling was palpable, you know, in terms of them being distraught
    over the assassination of King, on the one hand, and the fact that their two sons were in jail that same day, it was as if
    they knew something was going to change in their lives and in their sons’ lives.

DC: Do you remember talking with them about—I mean, you’re talking about how your own consciousness is—did they—were
    they moving along with you? Or did you talk with them about your consciousness developing at this point?

ED: No. You see, I—the whole cross-cultural experience—[mike glitch]

DC: Oops.

JB: Oops.[Recording stops and then resumes]

DC: ...whether you were having these conversations with your folks.

ED: Yeah, well, the whole cross-cultural experience, I think, was kind of an unspoken thing. I think they had put us in the
    environment, and so—and as I said, I wasn’t aware of—I thought that’s the way life was supposed to be. And so, I
    wasn’t aware of what its impact was on me growing up. I think the—when I was becoming aware, I don’t remember having
    the conversation with them. You know, I think that, like I said, when we went and marched with King, and my father said, you
    know, “We’re going to go to this march,” and we thought that was important because he said it was. And we knew that we
    had seen stuff on TV, and they had talked—we had talked about probably the Pettus, you know, the Bloody Sunday, and the
    bombing of the kids, you know, the church, and we had talked about those kind of things. But in terms of my own
    personal—you know, it wasn’t like they were directing me and observing this progression. These were things that were
    happening internal. And so, you know, I didn’t discuss—they obviously were aware when I was arrested [laughs] the first
    time for inciting a riot. And I had been interviewed by a newspaper—in fact, I’ll show you the clip here after we’re
    done—when I was seventeen, right in the middle of that, and you can see my Afro, I had the SNCC jacket on, and they were
    asking me about the Vietnam War.And my words to them—was they were asking if I thought it was a war worth fighting in. And
    my response—and they had asked several students, and I was one of several students that they put in this newspaper
    article—that World War II was something where people were fighting for something that was a worthy cause. We knew why we
    were in it; we knew that we were defending ourselves after Pearl Harbor was bombed.While I didn’t really fully understand
    the full implications of what the Japanese were faced with and this whole imperialist thing, I wasn’t fully aware and
    abreast of that, but I knew that from my father’s fighting in the war and showing his patriotic response that that was a
    natural patriotic response. But that here we were fighting an alleged enemy 15,000 miles away from the United States that
    had never attacked us and had never shown any aggression towards the United States. And so, my response was that, “No,
    this is not something that I think that people should be fighting for.”And so, I was—these were things that—and my
    parents saw the article in the newspaper, so they knew I—they had to know that I was developing a political consciousness.
    And I’m sure that I probably mouthed off some things, but I don’t remember sitting down and having this conversation.
    But it was at this point where things were—they knew that some sort of development was happening with their sons, because
    we were both arrested on the same day that King was assassinated in association with this event at Franklin High School. And
    it was about [clears throat] a week later, because we were already, Aaron and I and a group of people from Seattle, BSU
    students, were already lined up to go to the West Coast conference [clears throat] for black student unions in San Francisco
    at San Francisco State University. And Aaron and I had been talking much more about political organizing, and we actually
    had gotten ahold of a paper, a Black Panther newspaper. And so we were aware that the Black Panther Party existed and had
    some rough idea of who they were, [coughs] but we didn’t fully understand what they represented. But we knew that they
    were like a—developing into a powerful voice, at least in California, because the Black Panther Party started in 1966. It
    was not a national organization in ’67 or ’68, not yet.And here we were in the spring of 1968 and we traveled to San
    Francisco. [Coughs] And we had gotten wind that the day before Martin Luther King was assassinated, a young Black Panther by
    the name of Bobby Hutton had been assassinated and shot by Oakland police, and they were having his funeral that weekend.
    And a few of us said, “Well, we’re going over to show our support.”And that Saturday, we left the conference early and
    drove across the Bay Bridge into West Oakland. And I remember—I can still see the scene vividly in my mind today—when we
    got down on the street level in West Oakland, you started seeing large groups of black people gathering. Some of
    them—there was one big gathering in a park or in some area. You had Panthers, both men and women, in leather jackets and
    berets, lined up in like platoon formation. And I remember seeing that and thinking, “My God, this looks like a black
    army!”And we had to get out, of course, blocks away from the church in order to find parking. And we were walking through,
    you know, this scene, and everybody had on leather jackets and berets and black slacks. And I remember seeing a group of
    people talking off to one side, and there were whites in this group, and one of them was Marlon Brando. I recognized Marlon
    Brando. He was talking to who I would later find out was Bobby Seale. And when they—

DC: Can you remember your—I’m sorry to interrupt, but—your reaction to seeing what you described as a black army? What was
    it like to see—?

ED: It was overwhelming. It was both—you know, it was kind of like a culmination of this discovering who I was as a young
    black man and developing a consciousness and an identity, but seeing a group that looked organized and ready to defend their
    community. It was very stark contrast to the images that I saw on TV, with the singing demonstrators walking arm-in-arm, you
    know, singing “We Shall Overcome.” Because it—this looked like someone, a group of revolutionaries, who weren’t
    talking about “we shall overcome.” They looked like they were ready to take what was rightfully theirs, in terms of
    their human dignity and their rights and protect their community, and so, it was a sense of pride, of defiance. It was
    almost an overwhelming sense of, you know, “This is where I belong. This is who I am.” And when we got inside the church
    to view the body of Bobby Hutton, when we stepped into the church, lining the walls all the way around were young black men
    and women in Afros and berets and shotguns and bandoliers. And the casket was draped in a Black Panther flag. And all of
    these images were like—it was just a—it was a shock, you know. And I remember walking by the coffin, and I had heard
    that, you know, in conversation on the way there, that Bobby Hutton had been hit by thirty police bullets. And the reason
    why Mrs. Hutton, Bobby’s mother, wanted the coffin to be open is so people could see what the police had done to her
    son.And I remember when I was filing by Bobby’s, Little Bobby’s, coffin and seeing him in there—he was seventeen years
    old, and I was seventeen years old—and I remember thinking that, you know, that could be me laying there. And I think that
    was the moment for me where I said, “That’s it. This is who I am, and there is no turning back.”And people often ask
    me about that era in my life and that period, and they ask me if I was afraid. There was never any fear. I wasn’t afraid
    to—I can’t speak for other people, but there was never a fear about putting my life on the line or giving my life to the
    revolution, so to speak. It was a defiance and an indignant response to the racism and the racist brutality that the power
    structure in the United States had inflicted upon not only black people, but people that didn’t have means, whether they
    were poor whites, whether it be Native Americans, whether it be farmworkers, you know, immigrant populations, anyone who was
    different from the status quo. It was like this immense indignant response to this overwhelming oppression and dehumanizing
    of a people. And so, that all kind of gelled for me in that moment, and I’m sure for many of us. As we headed back to the
    conference, we knew that Bobby Seale was scheduled to speak that night at the BSU conference. And we waited for him to
    speak, and he showed up with his bodyguards and several Panthers. And he gave probably the most fiery speech that I had ever
    heard. And after his speech, you were either afraid, because it was like a line was being drawn in the sand, or you were
    destined to become a Panther and a revolutionary. A line was clearly drawn.And so, a small group of us—Aaron, myself, two
    or three others—not the whole contingent that came from Seattle, but a few of us went over and cornered Bobby and said,
    “We want to start a chapter of the Black Panther Party in Seattle.” And he told us to go ahead and finish this
    conference and return to Seattle, and that within two weeks he would be there and he would outline for us what we needed to
    do to organize the chapter. And we set that up, when his arrival would be, and the day that he came there were probably
    fifty potential Panthers in my parents’ home.

DC: How did you put the word out? 

ED: It went out through the grapevine. You know, the community has a grapevine. And, you know, fifty was a small core group at
    that time. And when my parents came home from work, all these bodies were laying on the floor and listening to Bobby talk.
    And they just came in, stepped over everyone, you know, stepped around and over, and went straight back into the kitchen,
    which was usually the gathering place, closed the door and left us alone. See, they knew something was coming, and this was
    the something.And we organized the chapter. Aaron, my brother, was given the leadership. He was the defense captain, I was
    field lieutenant, and we had a few other positions in there. And that began the journey. We were the first chapter to be
    organized outside of the state of California. And from that beginning, the chapters of the Black Panther Party spread like
    wildfire across the United States until we had a chapter in just about every one of the contiguous forty-eight states.

DC: What did—I’m curious what Bobby Seale said to you it meant to be a Panther and whether that changed for you over time.

ED: Well, it was pretty clear to us early on as we were trying to figure out, you know, how we were going to organize and, of
    course, it had to evolve. But it was clear to us, for most of us, that we were committed, we were in a lifelong struggle. He
    ran down the Ten-Point Program of the Black Panther Party.

DC: Can you just tell us what that is, the Ten-Point Program?

ED: Can you pause for one second?

JB: Sure.[Recording stops and then resumes]

ED: [Laughing] It’s a long time ago when I think about it. I’ve been married to my wife over forty years. Are we back on?

JB: We are. 

ED: The interesting thing is that—you know, you were talking about what it meant to be a member of the Black Panther Party.
    [Clears throat] And most of us who were younger than twenty at the time, because I was seventeen. My brother would have been
    nineteen. He’s about a year and six months older than me. And many of us were around that age group, eighteen, nineteen,
    twenty, seventeen. Most of us who were serious, we either knew that we would be dead before we were twenty-five, and those
    of us that accepted that reality didn’t care. Those that looked at it and knew that if they stayed in the Party they would
    be dead by twenty-five, they probably were out of the organization within six months because they weren’t willing to go to
    that extent. And so, what it meant was you had to be willing. You had to know what it meant to be a Panther, the fact that
    you would be probably in the line of fire now.Because it was in 1968, that very year, that J. Edgar Hoover claimed that the
    Black Panther Party was the number one threat to the internal security of the United States. That’s a pretty strong
    designation. That’s how they talk about Al-Qaeda today. So, if you put that in retrospect to 1968, and the Party being
    named the number one threat to the internal security of the United States, that meant we had a bullseye on us. And so, it
    was important for us to understand what it meant to be a Panther, as you said, how did Bobby communicate that?Because in the
    early days of the Black Panther Party, and I presume that you will end up interviewing Bobby Seale for this program, the
    Party had organized around a couple of basic principles. One was that people had a right to live [clears throat] a life and
    pursue the American dream without being shot and killed and brutalized in their communities. And we didn’t organize around
    civil rights, but we organized around what we believed were God-given rights, and the right to humanity and dignity was one
    of them.And when Huey and Bobby decided that they were going to form the Black Panther Party, they took the name from
    another organization that had the panther as a symbol. They were the Lowndes County Freedom Association, and they had the
    symbol of the black panther because the black panther by nature is a defensive animal, [clears throat] not an aggressor. So,
    we didn’t [clears throat] form initially to be the aggressor, but to take a defensive posture. And, in fact, the first
    name of the Black Panther Party was the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.And so, what had happened during those early
    years in ’66 and ’67, the first program that the Panther Party organized—we called them Survival Programs—was the
    Police Alert Patrol, because that was an immediate need in black communities across the United States, was to end the racist
    brutality by cops committed against black people, which is one of the points in the Ten-Point Program. And I’ll talk about
    the Ten-Point Program in a minute. [Clears throat] But when—in order to get that point across, Huey used to teach us that
    power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. And when they define that phenomena, the
    racist brutality in black communities—and Oakland and L.A. have historical, have a track record of historical racism and
    brutal treatment of black and Latino people. And in Oakland in the ’50s and ’60s, you know, it was routine for a black
    man to get shot, or a black woman to get shot, by police over minor incidents, a traffic incident or something, you know,
    where cops would just unleash their brutality.And so, when Huey and Bobby were first organizing the party, one, they armed
    themselves with the law. They understood that the—it’s interesting that there’s this gun debate going on now. [Clears
    throat] And, of course, this was at a time when there wasn’t a proliferation of guns in communities, let alone among kids
    and gangs now today. But when we were upholding the constitutional right to own and bear arms, [laughing] the gun lobby
    today, the NRA, opposed Panthers owning guns. It’s not surprising that, of course, they’ve done a 360 now today and they
    want all the guns they can get.But at that time, we knew that we had the Constitution on our side, Huey and Bobby did. They
    also studied the California penal code and understood that legally that they had the right to carry arms and they had the
    right to observe police carrying out their duty. So, they put those two together. They had also—one of the readings that
    they often read was the “Red Book” by Chairman Mao Tse Tung about revolutionary theory and practitioning.And so, when
    they organized the first program, the Police Alert Patrol, when they marched out on that street and faced down those cops
    [clears throat] on a Saturday night in Oakland, with six or seven Panthers with shotguns armed on the corner, telling them
    they weren’t going to brutalize that young man, that was really kind of the birth of the Panther mystique and the creation
    of the myth, if you will.Huey became almost a mythical figure from this, and he was the one who led this incident. When the
    police officer told him, “What are [you] doing with that gun, nigger? Give me that gun!” And Huey jacked around and
    threw the chamber of his shotgun and said, “This is my weapon. I have a right to carry this weapon. If you attempt to take
    it away from me, I’m going to defend myself.” And it was that moment that really captured the imagination of those
    people in Oakland. And so, the downside to that was—was that, because we were called the Black Panther Party for
    Self-Defense, people began to see the Party as their own community defense force. So, that meant, “Go get the Panthers to
    do this,” or “Go get the Panthers to do that.” And that was not what we were about. We were setting the example that
    you had the right to defend yourself and your community, and not have to take people brutalizing you unnecessarily,
    illegally, unlawfully, through racist attack. But you have the right to stand up and defend yourself and stand up like a
    man. And that was the message that we were sending, that the Party was sending very early. Well, that’s initially what put
    the bullseye on our backs, but as long as it was a localized organization in California, they didn’t get a lot of
    attention. The FBI probably thought that that would go away. But when this migration happened, and we were the first
    chapter, as I said, outside of the state of California, it became clear that this was going to be something that they were
    going to have to deal with.So, the Ten-Point Platform and Program really was about the basic needs of people within our
    community. I don’t know if I can read all of this, but it talked about what we want and what we believe, and I can
    summarize what the points were. We wanted an end to the racist brutality of police within our community. We wanted an
    education that represented the true nature of black people. We wanted an end to the robbery of our communities by what we
    called then the avaricious businessman who took resources out of the community and never gave anything back. We wanted
    health care, food, land, housing, education, justice and peace, to kind of summarize it all together. We wanted black men
    exempt from serving in military service. We wanted an end to all-white juries trying blacks in the court when, in fact, they
    are guaranteed by the Constitution to have a jury of their peers. Those were the elements of the Ten-Point Program.And so,
    when he kind of broke that down to us, it really established what we were about, that these were the things that we were
    going to pursue. And it was going to take a lot of organizing. We had to—because we had a bullseye on our back, we had
    to—every Panther had their own two guns and a thousand rounds of ammunition. And be prepared to defend yourself because
    you would be under attack. We had to read two hours a day to educate ourselves and understand the concepts and theories of
    revolution and what it meant to be an organizer and a leader.And so, we were basically preparing ourselves in those early
    years to become full-blooded revolutionaries that stood for something and that had a revolutionary philosophy and developed
    whatever the tools that we needed to become revolutionary practitioners. And this meant that we had to basically—we were
    giving our lives to this. And when the reality set in of the seriousness of it—see, we had the same kind of phenomenon
    that happened in Oakland happened here in Seattle. When Bobby Hutton was murdered in Seattle [Oakland], you know, a thousand
    people in the community joined the Black Panther Party overnight. It just exploded overnight.When we began to organize here
    in Seattle, within a couple of weeks, we had four hundred, five hundred Panthers that we were trying to organize and get
    into some sort of a disciplined structure. And a lot of people joined the Panthers, the Party, because it was kind of
    the—the “in” thing to do is not the right word, but it was a source of pride and a source of belonging, a source of
    identity. You know, this was during the turbulent ’60s, and people wanted direction. But most people didn’t really
    understand what it meant to create a revolutionary movement. You know, a lot of people in the black community across the
    country were used to spontaneous rebellions, and our movement wasn’t about a spontaneous rebellion. We were trying to
    build a political power structure that could challenge the status quo here in the United States. And we had to set out and
    build coalitions and gather resources and we had to know what it was that we were doing, and that took time and effort and
    commitment. And when it was clear—

DC: And discipline. [Laughs]

ED: And discipline. And when it was clear that this is what it was going to take, you know, talking about reading two hours a
    day [laughs]. I remember when I first picked up Wretched of the Earth written by Franz Fanon, I thought, “My God! How do I
    understand this?” But, you know, so we had political education classes every day, not every day, but weekly, where we
    would talk about what we read so we could get an understanding of what other revolutionary movements were about. And we
    began to realize that it was going to take effort in order to build this coalition and build this foundation.And so, within
    six to twelve months, most of those Panthers that came that first few weeks were gone, which was probably the best, because
    we boiled down to a hardcore group of Panthers, probably about twenty, that we knew that we could count on, not just for the
    glory. Because, see, in those—that first summer, we buried, I think two, maybe three Panthers here in Seattle. One of
    them, I think, it was either Butch Armstead’s or Henry Boyer’s funeral—I think it was Henry Boyer’s funeral—was
    the largest, at the time, the largest funeral in the state. Thousands of people attended, and the Panthers—we were all out
    in our leather jackets and berets and powder-blue shirts and lining the streets, you know, in front of the, you know, the
    mortuary.But so, you know, like, of course—guys had put on this uniform, and even women, you know—but the guys, you
    know, it was like this macho thing. It was a source of pride, but it was also a kind of, “Ooo, I’m a Panther!” And
    when we had to kind of create this disciplined organization, it wasn’t about just wearing the uniform and walking down the
    street and getting girls because you had a Panther uniform on. Yeah, we ended up—we expelled a lot of people, a lot of
    people left on their own, and we drilled down to this hardcore group of Panthers that were committed, and we began the
    process of political organization and kind of building this trust in the community. We started the—

DC: What was that—if you could talk a little bit about—

JB: [Recording stops and then resumes] 

JB: Okay, we’re back.

DC: I was going to ask about, you know, that difficult process—I would imagine a difficult process—of boiling down and the
    expulsions and the infighting. What was that like, since you were trying to do something for yourself, for your community,
    to experience that, those kind of difficulties?

ED: I think we understood that that was going to be a natural part of the process. Anytime when you are organizing something
    that is so involved and demanding of you as an individual, you know that there’s going to be people that are not going to
    be able to adapt to that kind of structure. It takes a certain person to be able to kind of give of themselves completely
    and kind of fall into this disciplined body, this disciplined organization. We were like a small army. And so, it required
    that we—that you kind of gave of yourself.It wasn’t like some organizations that are like where you have this hierarchy
    and there’s this submission. It wasn’t like that at all. It was more like a family. And you had to have this close-knit
    family, but to kind of go through the growing pains, to kind of get to that point, we realized it was going to be tough, and
    it was tough as we went through it.But, you know, I think that we understood—there was a core of us that understood what
    the Party meant and what it stood for, and so we were going to do whatever it took to make sure that we had, we came away
    with something that was going to be meaningful and make a difference and have an impact, because we were putting our lives
    out there on the line. Just because we began to do this community organizing didn’t take the bullseye off our back; it
    increased it. In fact, we were—a memo was sent out from our headquarters that said that leadership had to have two
    bodyguards—I had two bodyguards when I was seventeen and eighteen years old—because we understood the seriousness of it.
    And so—

DC: Did you move out on your own at that point, or were you living at home?

ED: I left that summer and moved out on my own. In fact, I left probably, you know, that was in April of ’68. I graduated from
    Garfield in June of ’68. By the end of June, I was out in my own apartment. And Aaron was already out. And it was—you
    know, in those early days, when I was still at my parents’ house, my bodyguard would come home with me at night and sit on
    my front porch. And I’d wake up in the morning, and he’s still sitting there. And, you know, I told him, “You can go
    home. I can take care of myself.”But my parents would get calls in the middle of the night. My mother would answer the
    phone, and somebody would say, “We’re going to kill that nigger son of yours tonight.” And she would say, “Go ahead
    and try,” because she knew that I could take care of myself and she knew Aaron could take of himself and she knew that we
    also had people that were standing at our side. And those were some of the things that my parents went through early on in
    those years. My father was visited at his job by the FBI. You asked me earlier about him having to navigate Boeing. I
    don’t remember—like I said, I don’t think he had to navigate Boeing so much. They were glad to have him. But it was
    when we became politicized that the FBI’s interest piqued up. Here he is, working on—you know, in a manufacturing plant
    that had government contracts. And so, he caught some heat behind that.But, you know, going through these growing pains,
    yes, it was painful, but at the same time, we knew it was necessary for us in order to evolve to where we wanted to. When we
    started our first free breakfast program in a church around the corner from my parents’ home, it was a church that I had
    been a member of the Boy Scouts in, and the pastor quite naturally said, “Yes,” while other churches turned us down.
    This was a white pastor who said, “Yes.” Black churches told us, “No.” This white pastor told us, “Yes.” It was
    because of that relationship that we had.And we realized—and we had members of the Party who—we had a Japanese Panther
    here, a couple of Japanese Panthers here in Seattle. And, while whites could not join the organization, our lawyers were
    considered kind of an extension of who we were, and we had several white lawyers that were defending us in court.And when
    you began to realize and understand the philosophy of the Black Panther Party, I remember three chapters in the Black
    Panther Party became targets immediately in 1968. When J. Edgar Hoover put out the memo to “destroy, disrupt, and
    discredit the Black Panther Party by any means necessary,” out to his field offices, they targeted three offices that they
    wanted to shut down. In fact, in the memo he said, “Prevent the rise of a Black Messiah.” And the three offices that he
    targeted were Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle.[Clears throat] They already had the bullseye on national headquarters in
    Oakland, and they had already got—Huey was in jail at the time, so they had already effectively pulled who they thought
    was the primary leader of the Party out of the Party, and Huey was locked up as a result of a gun battle he had with police
    where he was supposed to be killed. But he—he was shot, but he ended up killing one police officer and wounding the other.
    And [clears throat] so, they had him off the street.But L.A., Chicago, and Seattle were problematic for the FBI, in their
    eyes, because in Los Angeles, you had the leader of the Black Panther Party there, Bunchy Carter, who was the former head of
    the largest gang in Los Angeles, the Slausons. They had five thousand members strong. [Coughs] To have him as head of the
    Los Angeles chapter of the Black Panther Party and organizing, you know, five thousand gang members, let alone a truce
    between the other gangs, was very problematic for the FBI. In Chicago, you had the same thing, where Fred Hampton was
    organizing not only the black gangs in Chicago, the Disciples, the Blackstone Rangers, but also—you know, getting a truce
    between them—but also organizing young whites and young Latinos. And in Seattle, we had this broad coalition of Asians, of
    Latinos, of whites, and so that—and plus, here we were a little spot in the Northwest. A lot of people didn’t even know
    where Seattle was. [Laughs] But if we had a major impact, then I guess that would have been problematic for them.So, they
    targeted those three offices with the idea of assassinating the leaders in those three chapters. Bunchy Carter was
    assassinated in Oakland—excuse me, in Los Angeles. Fred Hampton—you’re probably aware of his assassination in Chicago.
    And they had several attempts on Aaron and my life here in Seattle.On one such attempt, Aaron—I used to run the target
    practice for Panthers once a weekend out at a target range that we had set up. And on one particular Saturday, I didn’t go
    out with Aaron to the target range, and Aaron had gone out with a group of Panthers. And as he prepared to fire his shotgun,
    he at first was going to fire it from his shoulder, but then he decided at the last minute he was going to try hip fire and
    brought it down to his hip. And the shotgun exploded, and it tore into his arm; he almost lost his arm. Of course, had he
    fired it from his shoulder, he would have blown his head off. And we knew that someone had doctored with his ammunition. And
    there were other attempts on his and my life in those years.But [clears throat] something that Fred Hampton said in ’68 at
    a large rally—and, in fact, there’s a video out about Fred Hampton and his death, and this speech is on there, where he
    says that—he’s talking to this large group on the South Side of Chicago—as a matter of fact, he’s on the West Side
    of Chicago in a church. And there’s white students in there, there’s Latino students in there, probably Asian, a lot of
    black people in there.And what he said to them was that, “The reason why we say, ‘All power to the people,’ what we
    mean when we say, ‘All power to the people,’ is that we mean that [clears throat] there should be white power for white
    people, brown power for brown people, yellow power for yellow people, red power for red people, and black power for black
    people—all power to the people! And what we need is a Rainbow Coalition.” And he coined that phrase, not Jesse Jackson.
    It came out of Fred Hampton’s mouth first. And so, we had always, from the beginning—that was in 1968—we had a
    philosophy around what we called “revolutionary inter-communalism.” And so, we had branches of the Black Panther Party
    in Australia, in Denmark, in Sweden, in Japan, in Germany. And so, we had coalitions here in the United States with the
    Peace and Freedom Party; the SDS; the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican group; the Red Guard; the AIM, the American Indian
    Movement. We had coalitions with all of these organizations. And while we would discourage them from trying to join the
    Black Panther Party, we encouraged them to organize within their own communities. So, we had this natural network and
    coalition that was really about a multicultural foundation to the Black Panther Party. And most people don’t realize that
    that don’t know the history of the Black Panther Party.And so, when I did that speech in France a few years ago on “From
    Revolutionary to Interculturalist,” we had always been interculturalists in the Black Panther Party, but my upbringing had
    always been multicultural, so it was like a full circle. It’s been a full circle in my life. [Coughs] And for me,
    personally, that began with the influences of my parents and where they had positioned us.So, we went on to organize the
    chapter. We ended up with five breakfast programs, where we fed over two thousand kids a hot meal every morning before they
    went to school. And our breakfast programs were strategically located in housing projects around the city: four of the
    housing projects, all four of the housing projects—Yesler Terrace, Holly Park, High Point, and Rainier Vista—and then
    one at the Atlantic Street Center , which had a more central location.We moved it out of the church and into—and oddly
    enough, the Atlantic Street Center was the first, the very first neighborhood community center that we hung out in when we
    moved here from Chicago in 1957, the very first one. And the head of that organization at the time was a gentleman by the
    name of Ike Ikeda. And Ike knew us when we were kids, and when we went down there to ask him if we could have the breakfast
    program there, it was a natural response, “Of course.”And so, it was that kind of coalition that we had across the city
    in all of these different neighborhoods. We had white liberals, wealthy, some white wealthy liberals that were supporters of
    ours in those early years, and continued to support us throughout the years, and even after the Party went away when we’ve
    done various events. But that foundation, that coalition that we built, sustained us through those years because when the
    chapter shrunk down to a core number of people, we were probably more effective than we would have been with this large
    group, because we utilized the networks and the coalitions to host things and to get our word out and to build our programs.
    In fact, when [clears throat] during the peace marches, the antiwar demonstrations, there was a doctor by the name of John
    Green, who was a neurologist at the University of Washington Medical School, who would—he had put together a band of
    medical students and a medical detail that followed the demonstrators who were marching. And on the front lines, when
    someone got billy-clubbed or tear-gassed, they would bring them to the back of these huge marches, and they would be
    administered health care.Well, we approached John about a free medical clinic, and he was all gung-ho and told us how
    to—you know, what we needed. And in our first—it’s actually our second headquarters, because the first headquarters,
    the real headquarters—we had an office prior to there, but probably one of our most notorious headquarters was up on 34th
    and Union, which ironically was around the corner from my parents’ house [laughter] right there in Madrona. And the
    building is still there. But that was the first kind of notorious Panther office.But when we moved out of there in 1969, the
    fall of 1969, it was because of the attacks that were happening on Party offices around the country. And so, we were ordered
    into not only more secure offices, but barracks. So, the building that we got was a duplex. Downstairs was the—our
    offices, and upstairs were the Panther barracks. And we had, eventually, two or three of those kind of buildings around the
    city, around the central area.And so, our primary building was there on 20th and Spruce. And, in fact, the People’s
    Wall—we had an artist paint a wall around the building, which is still there. I don’t know—you may want to go film
    that before you leave. It’s on the corner of 20th and Spruce. We had it refurbished about five years ago on our fortieth
    anniversary. But that was the office where we began to fortify the office. We had sandbags on all of the walls. We had
    bunkers inside for—gun bunkers. We had steel and plyboard sandwiches on the window.And that was the first site of our
    medical clinic. And Dr. Green set up the clinic in the back of the office, and he appropriated what we needed from the
    University of Washington. [Laughter] He told us to back a truck up to the hospital. He put in exam tables and medicine
    cabinets, you know, for the medications and equipment that he needed. He just loaded us up. And we established our first
    clinic there. He went, actually, on to open four other neighborhood clinics in the Seattle area, assist with opening those
    clinics. So, our first free clinic was there, put together by John Green. But the patients, when they came into the
    clinic— and our first service was a Well Baby Clinic for young mothers to address the—the infant mortality rate was very
    high among, in the black community in those years, and so, that was our first concentration. And when the pregnant mothers
    would come in, they would walk by, of course, the officer of the day. That was the office when you came in through this door
    that was about this thick, and it was always guarded with an armed guard. They would walk in, and then by the sandbags and
    along the bunker, and then back into the medical clinic to get their medical care. And, you know, people always said they
    felt secure when they walked in there, [laughs] you know.

DC: [Laughing] Right.

ED: It wasn’t like they were fearful of these sandbags. But they knew who we were, they knew that we were offering a free
    medical clinic, and people came. And that was the birth of our first free medical clinic. And, by the way, the Panther
    clinic is still operating today, the Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center. Carolyn was a young woman who worked with us in
    the ’70s and died when she was—before she was thirty, I believe, in 1978. We were no longer the chapter by then, but we
    continued the efforts of the organization.So, we probably had over thirty programs that we had organized, both here and
    around the country, the other chapters and branches. You know, we had the free bussing to prisons program. We had a free
    food program, which was some of first free food banks here in the area. We had a free shoe program, a free legal aid
    program, a free bussing to prisons program—I may have said that—senior aid, legal aid, and then our Summer Liberation
    School, which was the foundation for creating what they did at central headquarters in Oakland, the Oakland Community
    Learning Center.My brother, Aaron, was transferred out of the chapter, as was—the whole chapter was transferred out of
    Seattle in 1971. And I was serving time in a prison in Oregon for allegedly stealing a leather coat when I was down speaking
    on the campus at Oregon, the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon. And I spent fourteen months in prison in Salem, Oregon,
    as a political prisoner.And my—I remember that my—hearing about some of the efforts that were going on when I was locked
    up. My parents—my father and my brother had organized a meeting with the governor of Oregon at the time, who was a very
    progressive and liberal governor, Governor McCall. And they had arranged for a clemency hearing. And [clears throat] I
    didn’t know, you know, really how to respond to that, [laughs] because, you know, I was a dyed-in-the-wool revolutionary
    at that point, and any concession was not within my power to give, nor was I going to give it and appear to be in
    collaboration with, quote-unquote, “the enemy.” I had been subpoenaed, before I was locked up in 1970, before the House
    Un-American Activities Committee. And the reason why they subpoenaed me was because when they sent their congressional
    investigator out to find cooperative witnesses, Aaron instructed me to talk to the investigator. And he asked me, one of the
    things he asked me was, “Why do you feed kids a hot breakfast?” And I said, “You know, [laughs] look, how are you
    going to ask kids to go to school that are hungry and ask them to learn in a classroom where they’re comparing
    apples—you know, two apples plus four apples equals six apples? And you don’t expect their stomach to grumble? How are
    they going to focus and concentrate? You know, it makes sense to give them a nutritional breakfast.”And so, when I
    explained our programs to him, you know, why the free medical clinic, etcetera, so he took that to mean that I was a
    cooperative witness. But I was basically instructed to explain to him why we had these programs. And so, when I was
    subpoenaed, you know, I was told that, “If you get in there, you know, this is the House Un-American Activities
    Committee.” [Laughter] So, I knew that—my lawyers instructed us that, you know, you can answer—instructed me that I
    could answer my name and where I lived and what my occupation was. Anything after that would compel you to answer. [Coughs]
    So, after I gave them those three things, I told them—the very next question was, “Are you a member of the Black Panther
    Party?” And I said, “I refuse to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination. I take the Fifth Amendment.” And with
    each question, they grew more and more angry. It’s kind of like Nikita Khrushchev bouncing his shoe on the table. They
    were just so infuriated that they had flown me all the way to D.C., and I wasn’t a cooperative witness. And so, I knew
    that we were on one side, and the government was on the other.So, while I was in prison in ’71, Attica erupted. And George
    Jackson, who was a member of the Black Panther Party, was murdered in San Quentin. And after Attica, the captain of the
    prison called me and another Panther who was from the Portland chapter—Williams, Red Williams—called the two of us into
    the office, his office, and told us that if anything broke out in their prison, they were going to shoot us first. And so,
    we knew that we were still, even in prison, you know, the targets.

DC: Um-hmm.

ED: And so, when the governor’s office came to the prison, and the investigator said he was there for a clemency hearing, to
    pursue clemency, that the governor wanted to pursue clemency, my response to him was, “The only thing that I’ll—you
    tell the governor that the only thing that I’ll accept from him is an unconditional surrender.” And [laughing] the guy
    was like—

DC: [Laughing] “Who is this guy?” 

ED: [Laughing] “Who is this guy? We’re trying to get you out of prison!” But I didn’t want to get out under those
    circumstances. And so, while I was there, the chapter was literally closed in Seattle. Everybody was transferred to
    Oakland.

DC: Were you organizing while you were incarcerated?

ED: Oh, yeah. Well, there were at least three other Panthers in that prison. They were Oregon Panthers and myself. And, you
    know, we had to do subtle things around organizing. We would meet. We would hold political education classes. There wasn’t
    much more we could do other than keep ourselves abreast of what was going on, you know, and being aware of and not letting
    someone get taken advantage of in the prison, protect ourselves while we were in prison. [Clears throat] And so, it wasn’t
    the same kind, level of organizing we would obviously do on the outside.You know, the Oregon prisons are not what you would
    find in like a California prison, obviously, where political organizing—it was a hotbed of—there was a need to do that
    kind of political organizing in San Quentin or in Soledad. Oregon prison, you know, it was not nearly the platform for that
    kind of thing. So, we could keep ourselves abreast of what was going on, but there wasn’t a need for this kind of broad
    organization. There weren’t like gang warfares inside prisons, you know, that kind of thing, which George Jackson was
    beginning to form a coalition between—he organized the Latino prisoners and the black prisoners in San Quentin and
    Soledad, but we didn’t have that opportunity in the prison that I was in. So, it was much more low-key in that way.But, by
    the time I got out—I was paroled in late ’72—the chapter—there was a group of community workers that were still
    there. They had moved into a new building. The old office with all the sandbags was gone. And you could see kind of the
    shift in the era, from those early years in the Party to now, just a few short years later, where the sandbags were gone,
    you know. We weren’t sleeping with guns underneath our pillows, you know. It was a very different time, but we still went
    about the business of organizing the community. And that meant through organizing our survival programs. And so, the clinic
    was now in another building in the offices that we had now. No one, while we did have a 24-hour guard—someone had to be at
    the building twenty-four hours at all times—no one, you know, lived there.

DC: Can I ask you about—?

JB: [Recording stops and then resumes]

DC: [Laughs] 

JB: Okay, we’re back.

DC: Well, I was going to ask you about, because there’s the famous sort of split, right, as it’s sometimes called, within
    the Panthers about: Do we continue this sort of militarism and the guerrilla revolution—?

ED: Yes, yeah.

DC: Or focus on survival programs and meeting the basic needs of black people?

ED: Yeah, yeah.

DC: But it sounds like—your description of what happened in Seattle—there’s still kind of a mix of the two, or how did you
    see it playing out?

ED: Well, there was that mix of the two. There was that mix of the two probably in every chapter. We had that kind of
    mini-split, if you will, in our chapter early on in probably early 1969. And there was—in fact, he was our brother-in-law,
    who had more of a military, you know, “let’s do it now” kind of a mentality and did some things that were—engaged in
    some things that were kind of contrary to what we were about and what we considered to be, you know, like sensationalizing,
    you know, sensationalism.And so, there was that ideological split here in Seattle, but they faded quickly. In fact, several
    of them went to prison for a bank robbery. Others kind of just faded into the—it’s a little more involved. I’m not
    going to name names, but that split occurred, and we maintained control of the organization and continued to build the
    structure that Huey and Bobby wanted in the first place.The big ideological split on the national level was really
    perpetuated by informants and the FBI through COINTELPRO. COINTELPRO wasn’t just about assassinating leaders, because they
    could only get so close and they would only have so many opportunities. You know, they blew a couple of opportunities here
    in Seattle. They weren’t going to get that opportunity again.

DC: Can you define what that is, just for—?

ED: What—the opportunities?

DC: No, the COINTELPRO. 

ED: COINTELPRO was a program actually put together by J. Edgar Hoover way back in the ’30s, ’20s and ’30s, when he was
    consumed with the idea that the Communists wanted to take over the United States and the Communist threat. And [clears
    throat] so, COINTELPRO was an acronym for Counter Intelligence Program. So, he began this relentless spying and eventually
    phone-tapping, [coughs] and it was active all through the union-busting years in the ’40s, breaking up the unions, during
    the McCarthy era when they went on the witch hunt and blacklisted top actors from Hollywood, on into the Civil Rights
    Movement, when they wiretapped Martin Luther King and wiretapped the Kennedys.And so, it kind of evolved into—when the
    Party emerged, it was the new threat that they saw as a bigger threat even than King. And so, all of its—the
    COINTELPRO’s energies now were directed towards revolutionary movements across the United States, and the Panthers were at
    the top of the list. That’s why he declared the Party the number one threat to the internal security of the United States
    in 1968. And his infamous memo, which came out through the Freedom of Information Act, said “destroy, discredit, disrupt
    the activities of the Black Panther Party by any means necessary and prevent the rise of a Black Messiah.” [Clears
    throat.] Those were his words, and that was what COINTELPRO was focused on in those ’60s and ’70s.And so, part of their
    effort, if they couldn’t assassinate us, because we were armed in our headquarters—I remember when they attacked the
    L.A. office and they tried to run kids out of the L.A. breakfast program by storming the breakfast program and scaring the
    kids to death, but the community members would come back out and say, “No, we’re not going to be afraid of this. We’re
    going to continue to allow these breakfast programs to happen.”We used to have a—one of our theories was “Use what
    you’ve got to get what you need,” which meant use the resources at your disposal, and most of our breakfast programs,
    while we organized them and cooked in them, were eventually taken over by mothers that didn’t have jobs who would cook and
    run the breakfast program centers. So, they weren’t going to be bullied in that way.So, when they decided to attack the
    L.A. office—the L.A. Panthers had several members who were ex-Vietnam vets, combat vets, who had fortified the office and
    had created a network of ditches and tunnels when you came into the office. And the very first SWAT team was organized in
    L.A. to attack the Panther office, and they literally got their butts kicked, the SWAT team did.So, they had to figure out
    other ways to disorganize the Party, and one of them was to plant either informants in the Party—Fred Hampton’s
    bodyguard, who was the head of security for the Illinois chapter, was an FBI agent who drew the diagram of Fred’s
    apartment for that infamous raid where Fred was murdered. I later found out—in fact, I didn’t find out until this year
    that the body—one of the two bodyguards that traveled with me to Oregon when I got the charge for allegedly stealing a
    leather coat was an informant. And I didn’t know that for forty years, forty-plus years. 

DC: How did you find that out?

ED: Aaron was in contact with a reporter that got access to files by mistake. See, I got my FBI files back in the mid to late
    ’70s. I think it was late ’70s when the Freedom of Information Act hit. And they released a file that was about this
    thick, which was only a portion of what they would release. And even the file that they did release, about seventy percent
    of it is blacked out, and so you couldn’t see names or certain events that they didn’t want you to see. And then,
    there’s still a big old portion that they wouldn’t release. Well, somehow this reporter was doing a story this past
    year, and they mistakenly let out files that were not blacked out, and he saw the names of informants and got in touch with
    Aaron. And, sure enough, one of my bodyguard’s name was on that list.So, they were infiltrating the Party and they knew
    that this ideological split was occurring. And Eldridge Cleaver, who was head of the international branch and was also in
    the same shootout in which Bobby Hutton was murdered and had been in exile in Algeria—they started sending letters,
    anonymous letters, to Eldridge claiming that Huey was going to have him assassinated. And they did the same thing, sending
    letters from Algeria, the FBI-CIA, claiming that Eldridge was going to have Huey assassinated.And it exploded on national TV
    when the two were in a debate—well, actually, they were just supposed to be having a conversation, and that caused what
    became the Big Split. But that had been brewing for years, and that was I think in 1971, I think it was, when all that
    happened. So, it had already happened here in Seattle, and we had survived that. But on the national level, it was a big
    blow, because a lot of our friends and comrades that we trusted and still believed in were being expelled from the Party,
    and it was a very difficult time to go through, very difficult.

JB: [Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: We’re going again.

ED: Oh, you’re going? Okay. So, I had been talking about, prior to that, the reorganization of the Seattle chapter when I got
    out of prison. And it wasn’t like it was a total reorganization, because there was a core of Panther community workers
    that were—I don’t know if they were really considered members of the Party, but they still ran the office and were
    running the programs. The breakfast program was still being run out of a couple of locations; we expanded it back to five.
    The medical clinic was still being run a couple of days a week, but I closed it so that I could reorganize a family medical
    center, which eventually became the Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center. And then, we got a couple of other key members that
    joined at that point: Ron Johnson, who was like my deputy, my lieutenant, and helped put us back into this position where we
    were seen again as a viable community organization. In fact, in 1975, there was a local black newspaper, the Medium
    newspaper, which still is being published today, that had organized what they called the Unsung Hero Award. And it was
    expected that that Unsung Hero Award would go to prominent members of the community, you know, more mainstream. And one
    year, that year, ’75, we were nominated for the Unsung Hero Award because of our breakfast programs and the other work
    that we did, and we won the award.And the mayor and the city council president walked out of the proceedings before we could
    get the award. They went out the backdoor. [Laughs] It was on—it was being broadcast live on TV when we won the Unsung
    Hero Award, and we were still the Black Panther Party. It was a shocking moment for [laughs] for, I think, the establishment
    that the Black Panther Party would get that recognition.

DC: I was going to ask just that—

JB: That’s kind of a nice parallel with your experience at the Seattle Tennis Club.

ED: Absolutely! [Laughs]

DC: Yeah. I was just going to ask just that question that when you were doing the survival programs and clearly taking a
    leadership role in the community and providing things for the community, did the power structure start to come around
    or—?

ED: I don’t—

DC: What was the relationship with the mayor’s office?

ED: I don’t think the power structure came around. I mean, we were still very contentious, though there was an interesting
    thing that occurred in those early years when we were in the fortified office. And I think it was probably in 1970 when the
    chapter—it was right after the L.A. raid, and the FTA was making their rounds around the country raiding Panther offices,
    and they came to Seattle to raid the Seattle office.And Mayor Wes Uhlman at the time, when the FTA came to him for tactical
    support from the Seattle Police Department to raid the Seattle office, and he asked, “So, why do you want to raid the
    Seattle office?” And they said, “Because our informants tell us that they have illegal weapons,” which was always the
    excuse that they had was that the Panther offices had illegal weapons. And Wes Uhlman said, “Well, my informant tells me
    that they don’t have illegal weapons, that all of their weapons are legal,” which they were. And he said, “So, I’m
    not going to give you tactical support so you can have a bloodbath in my city.” And while we didn’t know that was going
    on, that conversation—and since then I’ve had a great relationship with Wes, the mayor at that time, and we’ve kind of
    talked and laughed about that, you know, thirty years later on panels when we’ve been talking together. But at the time,
    there was a reporter who was popular in Seattle, Don McGaffin, who was down in the police station that night that the raid
    was supposed to take place.And he was kind of hunting around for a story, as reporters usually do, and he saw these officers
    like polishing their weapons and strapping them on, getting their vests on, their bulletproof vests ready, and getting all
    of their stuff lined up. And he said, “What’s going on?” And they said, “We’re going to go get those Dixon
    brothers tonight.” And he was out on patrol with them and he called us before he left the station and said, “They’re
    going to raid your office tonight,” and so, he tipped us off.And we went on what we called Red Alert and buttoned down all
    the hatches, got on our phone trees, because we would have—we had a routine. First, lock everything up and get all your
    weapons lined up and your ammunition out, whatever, and gas masks on. We had full combat gear; we had bulletproof vests and
    gas masks. And we also had this phone tree where we would call ten people, and they would call—everyone that we called
    would call ten people, and everyone of them that were called would call ten people. Within, you know, a matter of twenty
    minutes, there were several hundred people out in front of the Panther office, so we had a buffer. And so, if they were
    going to attack the office, they had to clear these people out first and then have people—you know, get them far enough
    away, [laughs] but people would still be there and observing what was going on.

DC: Of course.

ED: We used that tactic several times when they were attempting to attack our office successfully to thwart off an attack. But
    that night, we were there and ready, and the raid never came. And we found out days later that the reason why it didn’t
    come was because the mayor had decided not to give the FTA, or the ATF, tactical support. In fact, that year, when he went
    to the National Mayors Conference in D.C., he was uninvited—he met—he was asked to go into a back room with Haldeman,
    who was on Nixon’s staff, and Haldeman blasted him and said, “Why did you do this? You thwarted what the president
    wanted, blah-blah-blah.” And he said, “You’re uninvited from the Presidential Dinner!” And he said, “Fine! We can
    go out and have a good time now,” [laughs] him and his staff. He tells that story—he would tell that story years later.
    But, see, I think that, while we had a contentious relationship with the powers that be, you know, there was always somebody
    like that that recognized, you know, that had some sense of civility and worth about who we were. And so, we didn’t openly
    hug arms with them, but after, you know—see, we had to make a transition. In 1976, there were a few incidents with central
    headquarters with me and Elaine Brown, who is now head of the chapter, and I won’t go into detail about it. You can read
    about it in the book. Aaron talks about it briefly in his book.But I wasn’t going to back down, and we ended up taking
    over all of the programs and basically seceding from the Black Panther Party, but we continued to run all of the programs.
    In fact, it was in those years, between ’68 and ’79, that we established the Carolyn Downs Family Medical Center. We
    still, in fact, credit it as a Black Panther clinic, because that’s where it grew out of, but it was in those years that
    we actually did the final arrangements and plans and got a building donated from—you know, I mentioned that we continued
    to have support in the community. There was a wealthy white businessman who was very progressive, who owned a building.Oddly
    enough, before cable became popular, it was, in fact, the precursor to—what’s the big cable conglomerate now? Xfinity by
    whatever it is? They had an office—they didn’t even have an office. Their tower was on Madrona Hill, because it was a
    hill, and they were in this small portion upstairs of this building that was sitting empty that this businessman owned.And
    we saw the building. We thought it would be a great location for the clinic, and we approached him about it, and we had
    somebody make the introduction for us. And he said that he would sell us the building, I think for—it was worth a quarter
    of a million dollars back then. He sold it to us for like twenty dollars, or two hundred dollars, or some ridiculous amount.
    And what he did—I remember what he did. He donated—no, it wasn’t twenty dollars. It was some amount, but he
    donated—he lowered the price, he donated the down payment himself, and then our monthly payment for the building came out
    of the rent that we collected from the cable company. [Laughter] It’s an interesting story.So, we still had these
    connections in the community, and we still had a presence, and they still knew of who we were. In fact, I had put plans
    together to open up a school similar to the one that was being run in Oakland. I think one of the things that got me in
    trouble with Elaine that I had the audacity to say that we could have a school here in Seattle. [Laughs] But we were in
    pursuit of that before life happened for me in a different way.You know, all of those years, from ’77—excuse me, ’67
    all the way up until 1982, my whole existence was giving back to the community, as was everybody, every Panther. You know,
    we called ourselves “servants of the people.” In order to be a servant of the people, you had to—you know, people came
    first, and your needs came second. So, I never had a desire to, you know, to buy a home or to—even though I had kids by
    this point. I was married along the way, and my wife was—I was still, I had just gotten out of prison. I had to teach my
    wife—I blindfolded her and put her in a dark room and had her dismantle an M-1 carbine and put it back together again, so
    that she could defend herself if I wasn’t around. And she took care of the Panther children for years, and we had our own,
    four of our own.And, even though we had families, we still—everything was centered on serving the community. We never took
    anything for ourselves. And it was at, you know, at some point, as a 32-year-old with growing kids, I realized, you know,
    [laughs] I’ve got to do something for my family. And I had been out of the Party now for six years.

DC: How did you make ends meet before that? Did people help you out?

ED: A variety of ways. My wife was on welfare. She got tired of that and went to school and got a job. And so, you know, we
    just—and within the organization, we would always make sure that Party members had their basic needs met. So, we didn’t
    get a salary or anything, but our basic needs were met. You know, help with the rent or food or whatever, that was always
    taken care of. So, that’s how we made ends meet. Party members always were able to collaborate and pool together resources
    so that everybody had what they needed to survive. But no one took salaries, you know, that kind of thing.And my story is
    kind of an interesting—took an interesting twist. I actually [clears throat] was introduced to Amway. And [clears throat]
    the thing that Amway did for me was, one, it made me realize that there were things in life that I could achieve beyond the
    Party and the Revolution, because that had been my whole life, my whole adult life until I was basically thirty-two years
    old. And I read three books that are books that I still share with people today, young people that are trying to figure out
    what to do with their lives.We read tons of books in Amway the brief time that I was in there, but the three that stood out:
    One was The Magic of Thinking Big, but I had always thought big, because I had always thought about, you know, the clinic
    and the school. I wanted to do more than just a small version, but I wanted something bigger, which is why I closed the free
    medical clinic to open the family medical center. I went from—decided we wanted to go from the concept of just the summer
    Liberation School, which we had expanded to a full-blown summer school program, to a full accredited school. And so, but
    that book kind of galvanized thinking about the possibilities for me and why I thought that way, which largely came from my
    father, as I mentioned, his being a visionary of sorts. And then, I read The Magic of Believing and The Power of Positive
    Thinking, which really began, you know, were the foundations of my own personal growth outside of the—beyond the Black
    Panther Party. I was very quickly able to turn the work that I had done—we had already transitioned the Party into a
    nonprofit group. We became instead of—the name of our first clinic was the Sidney Miller Free Medical Clinic. Well, I
    changed that into the Sidney Miller Community Service Center and got a 401(c)3 , and we operated as a nonprofit
    organization. We got a board of directors. I had prominent blacks on that board of directors, and our board president was
    Dr. Bob , who was really inspirational in continuing the leadership of, at that point, our organization, our nonprofit
    organization. And we eventually transformed the—you know, transitioned off the clinic to the nonprofit corporation, so it
    could become their own entity and continue to be run by the community, which is why it’s still running today. And—

JB: Excuse me just a second.

ED: Um-hmm.

JB: That’s better. Okay, we’re back again.

ED: And so, we transitioned the clinic into its own nonprofit so that it could become its own entity, which is why it’s
    maintained today.[Sighs] But my own transition, then, now was occurring, and these books and this experience with Amway
    taught me to begin to identify something that I could do on my own outside of the Party. And I didn’t know what that was
    going to be.My first job interview that I had was the director of the Al Davies Boys and Girls Club in Tacoma. And I nailed
    the interview, and I guess the confidence spewed out. And it was an interesting transition for me, because here was a club
    that primarily served the black community in Tacoma, Washington, which is a smaller city here to the south of Seattle. But
    out of the four Boys and Girls Clubs in that city, it was sitting on a gold mine, because forty years earlier, it was known
    as the Downtown Tacoma Boys Club, when in the inner city were wealthy white people. And they were the barons that owned the
    sawmills, you know, the pulp mills, and the shipping industry in Tacoma, and they left hundreds of thousands of dollars,
    which turned into millions of dollars, to that one club.And when I got there and—it’s kind of the—the irony is that,
    while they left it to that club when it was their sons and daughters who were going there—in fact, back then, it was just
    their sons, because it was the Boys Club, the Downtown Tacoma Boys Club. Forty years later, the flight had occurred,
    [laughter] and this club was sitting in the middle of the black community, and, in fact, they used some of those capital
    funds to build a brand new Boys and Girls Club. They had the newest club in the city. But the operational funds that they
    had access to—in one fund, they had a little over a million dollars in it, and the club had a right to spend, through the
    wills that they had left and through the rules, they had a right to spend up to ninety percent of the principal, which meant
    that the fund would always grow, but they would always have at least ninety percent of whatever the principal was at the
    time to put into operations.Well, when I got to that club, little if any of that money was going into that club. The
    executive director of Pierce County Boys and Girls Clubs, who was actually housed in my building, was using that money to
    keep afloat the other Boys and Girls Clubs. And the football team at my club—we had three age levels, and they were all
    sharing the same equipment, old equipment, sharing the same old equipment, which was unsafe, because some kids had big old
    helmets on that wouldn’t fit for the older kids, etcetera.So, I remember the first thing I did after I got a lay of the
    land was I told the executive, I said, “Look, I’m going to go before my board and ask for thirty thousand dollars to
    outfit my football team, you know, the three separate football teams, and put them in—so they have their own uniforms,
    etcetera.” And he said, “Well, that’s fine, but I’m going to oppose you.” And I said, “Fine. I’m up for a good
    fight.”So, my program director went out and got all—did all the research, you know, the safety regulations, why these
    kids should be in the three uniforms. I had parents come in to the board meeting and give testimony about their kids playing
    and the fact that the money that was supposed to be for that community should be there. And when it came to a vote—all my
    board members were white except for one black businessman—I remember a young white businessman leaned back in his chair
    with his big cigar, and he said, “Hell! I like football!” [Laughter] And everybody else rolled after that, and the money
    was given for the football team.And I turned around—like, I started new programs there because I had come out of this
    experience where you organize in a community. And so, I spent a couple of years there, and it was time to move on. And I
    ended up—my father, before he passed, suggested that I interview, go to—actually, not interview, but go and ask Walter
    Hundley, who had been the director of the Model Cities Program and now was the superintendent of the Seattle Park
    Department, and go to ask him for—I’d been out of work for a couple of months now and I needed a job. So, I went down to
    Walter to see if there was some way he could find a position for me.And he said, “Well, you know, we’ll see.” He said,
    “We’re going to try you out in a position. I’ve got something I—we’ll find out something for you, and we’ll see
    how that works out.” And he said, “But I want you to remember the time you came into my office with your shotguns
    drawn.” And I said, “Oh! Yeah, [laughing] I do kind of vaguely remember that.” No way I could get out of that! So,
    what he ended up doing was, I ended up being appointed as the training manager, or training officer, and more significantly,
    he also named me the EEO officer. And so, I knew nothing about EEOC, so I had to educate myself and I went down and got
    books. I went to the EEOC office and read all this stuff. And so, then I ultimately was responsible for drafting their
    sexual harassment policy and designing training, sexual harassment training, and training it, but more importantly,
    enforcing it. And it was at a time when women were still considered, you know, excess baggage in
    traditional—nontraditional workplaces. And so, in the trades in the Park Department—they had plumbers, electricians,
    carpenters, painters, truck drivers—Walt instructed me to go out and recruit women for these positions.And so, I developed
    a recruiting program and recruited them into these positions in offices where these old-school guys, the old boys network,
    thought that women should be barefoot and pregnant. And so, I became the enforcement officer to protect them once we hired
    them, protect them against harassment, sexual harassment. And so, I got kind of the reputation around there, “Who is he
    coming to get today?” if I came out and inspected a work area or came out and talked to people. I ended up
    recommending—I couldn’t fire them, but I recommended the firing of several key high-level managers in that department
    that were held up—the firings were held up under review.And it kind of got me a reputation of being—you know, it was
    back to—the circle also had come full circle in that work, in that when we were in the Party, you know, prostitutes would
    come to us and want us to help them get off the street. Women who were being beaten by their husbands would come to us to
    stop the beating. And we would go do it. And so, here I was in this role in a professional capacity protecting women and
    helping them [coughs] navigate through these jobs.It wasn’t about five or six years after that, after I had gotten into
    that role, that two women that started this company that I’m currently president of, Executive Diversity Services,
    contacted me to be a part of their company. They had heard something about the work that I had done. And I left the City and
    I started working with them in ’88. They formed the company in ’87. I left the City in 1990 and haven’t looked back
    since. And now, I’m president of Executive Diversity Services and I do multicultural work across the globe.And the work
    that I do around diversity and inclusion and getting organizations to identify ways to value differences and create
    inclusive workplaces is what I do today. And that really is the full-circle piece. And so, when I landed in France three
    years ago to give this presentation, it was about that transition from revolutionary to interculturalist, but it really
    started with that multicultural experience in Madrona. That’s where it all began.

DC: Um-hmm.

JB: [I’m going to] stop for a second? [Recording stops and then resumes]

JB: We’re back on.

DC: So, because we are in this sort of wrap-up, you know, looking back, reflective conversation, I just wondered what—you’ve
    talked a little bit about, I think, some of what you might be proud of, as far as accomplishments—but I’m curious what,
    for you, is the accomplishment that you feel most proud of? And then, I’m also interested if you have any regrets, looking
    back.

ED: Well, you know, I think that probably—and I would probably share this with my comrades in the Black Panther Party, because
    we didn’t do things for individual achievement—was that we were, I think I’m most proud of the fact that we were
    principled, that we stood for—we meant what we stood for and we stood for what we meant. We didn’t deter from that. We
    couldn’t be bought off. And we considered ourselves the vanguard because of that, because we had that—it’s more than
    pride. It’s kind of we had that character that we stood for something, and I think that that’s what I’m most proud
    of.The other things were [clears throat] the natural result of our organizing and our efforts, you know, the breakfast
    programs, the clinics, [clears throat] the various things that we accomplished and did for the community. We take a
    collective pride in that; that was all of us that did that. But I think it’s the fact that we stood for something and we
    stood by it, we were principled and we stood by those beliefs, and we never gave in to them, I think that’s the thing that
    I’m most proud of, and proud of it, as I said, in a collective sense. It’s not an individual thing.

DC: Um-hmm. Any regrets, looking back?

ED: Yeah, that we didn’t get Nixon out of office sooner. [Laughter] You know, there’s a lot written about the Gen X, you
    know, that followed our generation, the Boomers, and the fact that there was a fair amount of political apathy and kind of a
    lost sense of what to do, and I think the fact that we didn’t fully realize all of our goals, you know. I think there’s,
    you know, obviously there are things along the way that one might wish that they could have done differently or handled
    differently. And so, I think it’s kind of pointless to look back and have too many regrets. You have to look at the good
    things that override some of things that maybe weren’t as good, and you know be proud of those things and the fact that we
    survived and we accomplished those things and we left a lasting legacy. So, if there is a regret, [laughs] we didn’t
    change things enough, because there’s still so much to be done.

DC: And finally, a related—I’d just like to ask you to reflect on the term “Civil Rights Movement.” I’m sure people
    come to you to ask you about your involvement in the Movement. What is the Civil Rights Movement? How do you define it or
    look at it? 

ED: Well, [clears throat] see, I think the actual event is bigger than the Civil Rights Movement. We never considered ourselves
    civil rights activists. My initial reaction to and understanding of civil rights, when you think about Jim Crow laws and you
    think about ending segregation and trying to achieve some form of equality in a variety of areas, I think that that is—was
    needed and relevant in the achievement of those things. We saw our struggle one for human rights and on a much broader
    plane, at least in our eyes.And that’s not to put down the Civil Rights Movement, you know, the movement in the South to
    end segregation, to be able to ride on a bus or to sit at a lunch counter. Those were important things. We tended to point
    towards the denial of basic humanity and the right to exist as a human without being subject to racism and poverty and human
    dignity. And so, I think that the Civil Rights Movement meant that. We approached it from a more of a “we’re going to
    take it back” than “give it to me” kind of approach, and that’s I think what put us in the crosshairs.And so,
    that’s what our Movement was about. It was a revolutionary philosophy. It was, in our eyes, it was much more—in our
    eyes, it was much more impactful, much more tangible to take it all the way. I mean, I think you could people all of the
    civil rights that they want and still deny them the basic right to humanity. And so, I think it was more about God-given
    rights than just civil rights is what we were involved in, what we stood for.

DC: So, where are we now, do you think?

ED: Whew! [Laughs] We’re still on the trail. I think that the impact of—it’s not obviously just racism. It’s the impact
    of—I think it has always probably been about haves and have-nots, and who has the upper hand, and who are the downtrodden,
    who’s got the resources and who doesn’t. And that can rear its ugly head in so many different ways.I think that
    the—this, what they call the Great Recession of the last five years, I think just galvanized for a lot of people how
    delicate of a ground people stand on. During that time frame, when people—people still are losing their homes and their
    livelihoods. I was listening to a report out of Greece just about a month ago, where the middle class there has almost
    completely been wiped out, where people who had nice middle-class jobs have to go out and beg for food today. And you see
    that happening now in Spain, where the unemployment rate is I think fifty-some percent or some awful number.And the fact
    that all of that happened because of a small group of greedy businessmen that banked on the housing market collapsing so
    that they could get rich. And during that time span, the last five or six years, while all of this has been happening to the
    middle class, let alone what has happened to the poor, the rich have gotten ten times richer and the gap has gotten bigger.
    And, you know, I’m a realist and I’m also conscious of the fact that the world is not just full of evil. My mother was
    telling me about a story that she saw on TV last week about a group of doctors who—and it doesn’t matter what color they
    are—a group of doctors who have a ship that is off the East Coast of Africa that are treating patients who have been
    grossly disfigured by a variety of things, whether it be lack of nutrition in their diets and disease, faces are badly
    deformed, teeth where they can’t even chew their food. And they travel to these countries and they specifically focus on
    that Eastern Coast in Africa where there’s a large number of people that suffer from this. And they go in and they work
    with them. They diagnose them, they x-ray them, and they bring them on their ship and they totally reconstruct their
    face.And this one woman who was blinded by cataracts and couldn’t see the disfiguration, but knew that she had been
    disfigured, and when she looked into the mirror and saw, when they had removed the cataracts and replaced her lenses so that
    she could see and had reconstructed her face, you know, the joy in that woman’s face and the joy in those doctors’
    hearts when they saw what they had done —and their lives are given to that kind of transformation. There’s a lot of good
    on this earth in this world in which we live.And so, I don’t dwell on the bad things. I know that we’ve got a lot that
    we need to, you know, that there’s a lot to be done. One thing that my experience in the Party taught me is that one
    organization or one individual can’t do it all. And so, you find little things that you can be part of and that you can
    contribute to.There’s a lot of—I was watching an ESPN episode this morning, and they were talking about these teams,
    just random teams around the country where a little boy with cerebral palsy, they let him enter into—he was a wrestler,
    and they let him enter into a wrestling match. And his opponent, who could easily have beaten him, let him pin him to the
    ground so he could feel this joy of winning. Another boy who was autistic who wanted to play basketball and couldn’t play,
    and at the end of the game, they made sure that he got in the game to score. And when he missed the shot and it went out of
    bounds, the opposing team, instead of throwing it to their teammate, called his name and threw it to him. He thought he made
    a steal and got his score, you know, so he could feel good about himself.You hear things like that, you know? You know, for
    every bad thing that you hear, there’s a lot of good things that are going on. And so, I think it’s important that, you
    know, while you look at where we are, and we still have lots of things to overcome, there’s a lot of good things that are
    happening. And so, I try to focus on the little bit of good that I can do, the little bit of change that I can make. My work
    is about that. But there are other things that I’m working on to also try to impact some change. And so, who knows? Maybe
    we’ll get there, and maybe we won’t [be blown up as a planet]. [Laughter]
